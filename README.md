# Flatiron Capstone Project

## Film Script Success Prediction Using NLP

### Objective

The objective of this project was to use text data from movie scripts produced over the last 20 years to build a machine learning model to predict the success of future unproduced film scripts. This project has application for the film industry in that it can save the film industry hundreds of millions of dollars per year in wasted salary for script readers, wasted revenue for unproduced would-be-successful scripts, and avoided losses for producing film failures.
