Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.\\n\\n  \\nSomewhere buried in this desert,\\nour ancestors built a great machine.\\n\\n  \\nIt harvests Energon by destroying suns.\\n\\n  \\n- Destroy suns?\\n- You mean blow them up?\\n\\n  \\nYes. You see, in the beginning,\\n\\n  \\nthere were seven Primes,\\nour original leaders.\\n\\n  \\nAnd they set out into the universe,\\nseeking distant suns to harvest.\\n\\n  \\nThe Primes set out with one rule,\\nnever destroy a planet with life,\\n\\n  \\nuntil one of them tried to defy this rule.\\n\\n  \\nAnd his name forevermore\\nwas the Fallen.\\n\\n  \\nHe despised the human race\\n\\n  \\nand he wanted to kill you all\\nby turning on that machine.\\n\\n  \\nThe only way to activate it\\nis with a legendary key\\n\\n  \\ncalled the Matrix of Leadership.\\n\\n  \\nA great battle took place over\\npossession of the Matrix.\\n\\n  \\nThe Fallen was stronger than\\nhis brothers,\\n\\n  \\nso they had no choice\\nbut to steal and hide it from him.\\n\\n  \\nIn the ultimate sacrifice, they gave\\ntheir lives to seal the Matrix away\\n\\n  \\nin a tomb made of\\ntheir very own bodies,\\n\\n  \\na tomb we cannot find.\\n\\n  \\nSomewhere, buried in this desert,\\nthat deadly machine remains.\\n\\n  \\nThe Fallen knows where it is\\n\\n  \\nand if he finds the tomb of the Primes,\\nyour world will be no more.\\n\\n  \\nOkay, so how do we stop him?\\n\\n  \\nOnly a Prime can defeat the Fallen.\\n\\n  \\nOptimus Prime?\\n\\n  \\nSo, you\\'ve met a Prime?\\n\\n  \\nWhy, you must have met\\na great descendant.\\n\\n  \\nIs he alive, here on this planet?\\n\\n  \\nHe sacrificed himself to save me.\\n\\n  \\nSo, he\\'s dead.\\n\\n  \\nWithout a Prime, it\\'s impossible.\\nNo one else could stop the Fallen.\\n\\n  \\nSo, the same energy that\\'s gonna be\\nused to reactivate the machine,\\n\\n  \\ncould that energy somehow be used\\nto reactivate Optimus\\n\\n  \\nand bring him back to life?\\n\\n  \\nIt was never designed for that purpose,\\nbut it\\'s an energy like no other.\\n\\n  \\nSo, then how do you get us to the Matrix\\nbefore the Decepticons get to me?\\n\\n  \\nFollow your mind, your map,\\nyour symbols.\\n\\n  \\nWhat you carved in the sand,\\nit\\'s your clue.\\n\\n  \\nWhen dawn alights the Dagger\\'s Tip,\\nThree Kings will reveal the doorway!\\n\\n  \\nFind the doorway!\\n\\n  \\nGo now!

Alright?\\n\\n(whispered, he \\n\\nsurreptitiously points to \\nhis cap)\\n\\nMU is.\\n\\nEmployees (Scarers, assistants, can wranglers, etc.) start to \\nstream onto the floor.  The tour guide ushers Mike and the \\nstudents to a viewing area. \\n\\nON MIKE, studying everything on the scare floor.  Not \\nwatching, he puts a foot past the line.\\n\\nMI TOUR GUIDE\\nOops.  Stop right there.  Don’t \\ncross over that safety line, human \\nchildren are extremely toxic.\\n\\nMike steps back and watches all the activity, in awe.  But \\njust as the doors start to get wheeled onto the floor, the \\nbigger kids push their way to the front, blocking Mike’s \\nview.\\n\\nMike pops out from the back of the crowd and falls on his \\nbutt, but pops right back up again.\\n\\nKIDS\\n(excited walla)\\n\\nLook at that!\\n\\nYOUNG MIKE\\n\\nWhoa - hey...guys, watch the eye!  \\nOw!\\n\\nKIDS\\n\\n(walla)\\n\\nWhoa!/Wow!\\n\\nYOUNG MIKE\\n\\nExcuse me, fellas.

GRAVES\\n\\n(scream)\\n\\nMichael?!\\n\\nThey all see Mike watching the MU scarer as he opens the door \\nto the human world and slinks inside.  The door starts to \\nclose behind him.  But not before Mike, moving fast, slips \\nthrough the door and into the human world too!\\n\\nINT. HUMAN KID’S ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nInside the human kid’s room, Mike hides in the shadows as the \\nscarer starts his stealthy approach to the kid.  The scarer \\nis totally unaware that Mike is in the room.\\n\\nMike’s terrified, but the more he watches the scarer, the \\nmore he gets caught up in the excitement and awe of it all.\\n\\nThe scarer is about to scare when suddenly the kid’s bedroom \\ndoor opens and the parents peep in.  Mike is hiding right \\nbehind the door, inches away from the humans!\\n\\nThe scarer hides too, blending into the shadows.\\n\\nSee, I told you he’s fine.\\n\\nMOM\\n\\nDAD\\n\\nWell, I thought I heard something.\\n\\nThe parents close the door and the scarer re-emerges, \\ncontinuing to build his scare.\\n\\nMike watches the scarer scratch the end of the bed.\\n\\nThe kid hears this and rises up in bed.  The scarer slides \\nunder the side of the bed and then looms up over the kid.\\n\\nSCREAM!\\n\\nON MIKE as he watches.  His mouth falls open, in awe.\\n\\nINT. SCARE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nThe scream can fills to the top.\\n\\nThe MU scarer steps through the door, a satisfied look on his \\nface - a solid scare.

You \\ncoulda got yourself killed, kid!  \\nDid you touch anything?!  Do you \\nknow what could have happened?!\\n\\nMeanwhile, as the scarer who was in the room with Mike dons \\nhis MU hat, someone comes over and confers with him.  The \\nscarer looks over at Mike, putting things together.\\n\\nAs the angry walla continues, the MU scarer approaches Mike \\nagain, sternly.  Mike is still in awe of everything he just \\nsaw.\\n\\nMU SCARER\\n\\nThat was real dangerous, kid.  I \\ndidn’t even know you were in there.\\n\\nMike looks at the scarer, ashamed.  \\n\\nAnd then, the scarer can’t help but smile, realizing \\nsomething.\\n\\nMU SCARER (CONT’D)\\n\\n(impressed)\\n\\nWow, I didn’t even know you were in \\nthere....\\n\\n(laugh)\\n\\nNot bad, kid.\\n\\nMRS.

Johnny looks to Sulley.\\n\\nSulley turns back to Mike confidently, but it’s all for show - \\nMike has gotten under his skin.\\n\\nON Mike as Sulley walks by and “accidentally” bumps Mike’s \\nbooks off the wall.  Mike glares at him.\\n\\nMIKE\\n\\nHey, do you mind?\\n\\nSULLEY\\n\\nDon’t mind at all.\\n\\nSulley starts warming up, obnoxiously, right by Mike.\\n\\nSULLEY (CONT’D)\\n\\n(quietly)\\nRoar!  Grr!!  Arr!\\n\\nMike shoots daggers at Sulley.\\n\\nC’mon Mike, let’s just move.\\n\\nMike jumps down near Sulley and picks up his books.\\n\\nRANDY\\n\\nMIKE\\n\\nStay outta my way.  Unlike you, I \\nhad to work hard to get into the \\nscare program.\\n\\nSULLEY\\n\\nThat’s because you don’t belong \\nhere.\\n\\nMIKE\\n\\n(beat)\\n\\nRahr!\\n\\nSulley is surprised but he roars back.\\n\\nSULLEY\\n\\nRoar!\\n\\n(laugh, to himself)\\n\\nThat’s what I thought....\\n\\nSulley goes back to practicing as Mike’s cocky smile melts.  \\nHis words have gotten under Mike’s skin.\\n\\n      \\n\\n\\x0c45.\\n\\nMike gets into Sulley’s face and starts practicing his scares \\ntoo.\\n\\nSULLEY (CONT’D)\\n\\n(quietly)\\n\\nRoar!

With every lunge, \\nMike does a different move.\\n\\nOther students start to take notice of the guys.\\n\\nRandy looks up at Hardscrabble, concerned.  He sees that \\nHardscrabble is taking notice....\\n\\nMike and Sulley get closer and closer to one another and then \\nSulley steps back, tripping on the books.\\n\\nSULLEY\\n\\n(stumbling back vocs)\\n\\nWhoa-\\n\\nSulley stumbles back and bumps into the stand holding \\nHardscrabble’s scream can.  It starts wobbling....\\n\\nThe can wobbles strongly then falls.\\n\\nThere’s a beat - then it appears to be undamaged.  Whew- \\nthey’re safe.\\n\\nSuddenly, the scream is released, sending the can spinning \\naround the room!  Students have to duck out of the way as it \\nflies back and forth.\\n\\nIt finally lands in front of Mike and Sulley, emptying \\ncompletely.\\n\\nSuddenly a huge, dark figure lands in front of them, wings \\noutstretched.  Mike and Sulley come face to face with Dean \\nHardscrabble.  She picks up her empty scream can.\\n\\nRandy looks from Mike and Sulley to Hardscrabble, then blends \\nhimself invisible.\\n\\nMIKE\\n\\nI’m so sorry.\\n\\n      \\n\\n\\x0c46.\\n\\nSULLEY\\n\\nIt was an accident.\\n\\nHARDSCRABBLE\\n\\nWhat, this?  My one souvenir from a \\nlifetime of scaring?  Accidents \\nhappen don’t they?  The important \\nthing is: no one got hurt.\\n\\nMIKE\\n\\nYou’re taking this remarkably well.\\n\\nHARDSCRABBLE\\n\\nNow, let’s continue the exams.\\n\\n(to Mike)\\n\\nMr. Wazowski, I’m a 5-year-old  \\ngirl on a farm in Kansas afraid of \\nlightning.

So a roar \\nwouldn’t make him scream, it would \\nmake him cry, alerting his parents, \\nexposing the monster world, \\ndestroying life as we know it, and \\nof course, we can’t have that, so \\nI’m afraid I can not recommend that \\nyou continue in the scaring \\nprogram, good day.\\n\\nSULLEY\\n\\n(laughing, then it dawns \\n\\non him)\\n\\nWait, what?  But I’m a Sullivan.\\n\\nHARDSCRABBLE\\n\\n(smiling)\\n\\nWell then, I’m sure your family \\nwill be very disappointed.\\n\\nSulley is incredulous, confused.  He looks up into the \\nstands, just in time to see the door swing shut on Johnny and \\nthe RORs as they exit.\\n\\nSulley can’t believe this is happening.\\n\\nHe turns to Mike and stares at him with pure hate and then \\nmarches off.\\n\\nMike watches Sulley leave, concerned.\\n\\nHARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)\\n\\nAnd Mr. Wazowski, what you lack is \\nsomething that cannot be taught, \\nyou’re not scary.\\n\\nMike stands there, stunned.\\n\\n      \\n\\n\\x0c48.\\n\\nHARDSCRABBLE (CONT’D)\\n\\nYou will not be continuing in the \\nscaring program.\\n\\nMIKE\\n\\nPlease, let me try the simulator, \\nI’ll surprise you.\\n\\nHARDSCRABBLE\\nSurprise me?

He stares out the \\nwindow at the School of Scaring in the distance.\\n\\nBeat.\\n\\nPROFESSOR BRANDYWINE\\n\\nWelcome back, I hope everyone had a \\npleasant break.

We will now plunge into the \\nrich history of scream can design.\\n\\nMike looks over to Sulley who is glaring at him.

He heads toward his dorm.\\n\\nWe pull out and reveal that Sulley is walking next to him, \\nstill glaring....Mike pays no attention.\\n\\nSulley stops and watches Mike walk off ahead of him.\\n\\nINT. MIKE’S DORM ROOM\\n\\nMike slowly walks into his room, depressed, shutting the \\nworld out.\\n\\nHe stands by his bed and stares at his MU hat, then looks out \\nthe window at the School of Scaring across the quad.  His \\nheart breaks.\\n\\nHe looks down at his lame scream can tech book.  His \\nfrustration boils and he throws the book against the wall.\\n\\nThe book knocks down his calendar revealing the Scare Games \\nposter.  Mike’s brow raises and a smile slowly grows across \\nhis face.  He quickly tears the poster off the wall.\\n\\nINT. FRESHMEN DORM HALLWAY\\n\\nMike opens his door and Sulley is standing there, still \\nglaring.

Has to separate from Slinky, and hold \\nhis paw, to extend his reach. Not enough...RC slips further, \\nwhen -- Woody suddenly can grab hold of RC! \\n\\n...He looks back to BO AT THE WINDOW.

I\\'m asking...\\n... what you believe.\\nI believe what I see, sire.\\nAnd when you look at the stalk,\\nwhat do you see?\\nI see a way up and a way down.\\nAnd I pray, as do all my men,\\nthat your daughter finds her way down.\\nAnd if something else\\nfinds its way down first?\\nWell, that would mark a time\\nwhen no man...\\n... from noble birth to lowest...\\n... would wish he were king.\\nSorry, general. It looks like mankind\\nis off the menu this evening.\\nYou.\\nMe?\\nNo, not... You.\\nHuh?\\nI have a job for you.\\nIt\\'s a hell of a view, my old friend.\\nThat should stop...\\n- ... the bleeding.\\n- What is it?\\n\\nPage 23/35\\n\\n\\x0cYarrow.

The moment he clears\\nthat hole we make a run for it.\\nWhat the...?\\nBees!\\n\\nPage 24/35\\n\\n\\x0cWhy do these things\\nalways happen to me?\\nWhoa!\\nYou did it, Jack.\\nYou did it.\\nUh, right.\\nLet\\'s go.\\nPrincess, Jack.\\n- Go. I\\'ll be down as soon as I can.\\n- What? No, Elmont, we go together.\\n- I\\'m not going anywhere without that crown.\\nThat\\'s not the mission.\\nFind the princess and bring her home.\\nYou complete the mission,\\nget her to her father, leave Roderick to me.\\n- But...\\n- Did you ever kill a man?\\nGo.\\nThank you.\\nHere.\\nThank you for saving...\\n... my life.\\nYou\\'re one of us now, Jack.\\nI\\'m honored.\\nJust come back to us...\\n- ... okay?\\n- I will.\\nGo.

       "\"Prince of Persia\\nThe Sands of Time\\n\\nby\\nJordan Mechner\\n\\n \\n\\nRevisions by\\nJeffrey Nachmanoff\\n\\nOctober 23, 2006\\nJerry Bruckheimer Films\\n\\n\\x0cFADE IN\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT\\n\\nSUPER:  PERSIA - THE NINTH CENTURY\\n\\nTwo PERSIAN SOLDIERS man a lonely sentry post.  They rub \\ntheir hands over a sputtering fire.  \\n\\nOLDER SOLDIER\\nYour turn to gather more firewood.\\n\\nYOUNG SOLDIER\\n\\nIt’s always my turn.\\n\\nOLDER SOLDIER\\n\\n(grins)\\nYou’re learning.\\n\\nThe YOUNG SOLDIER pulls his cloak tighter and trudges off, \\nresigned.  \\n\\nThe OLDER SOLDIER stamps his feet and sneaks a swig from his \\nwineskin to ward off the chill.  A horse whinnies and he \\nlooks up.  \\n\\nA CARAVAN approaches in the moonlight:  four shrouded FIGURES \\nleading horses and wagons. \\n\\nThe Old Soldier picks up his spear and steps into the road.\\n\\nOLDER SOLDIER (CONT’D)\\nHalt in the name of the Persian \\nArmy!  What is your business?\\n\\nCARAVAN LEADER\\nWe are Bedouin traders, sir, on our \\nway home.  We humbly beg leave to \\npass.  \\n\\nThe Caravan Leader bows respectfully.  He wears a black head \\ncovering that conceals most of his face.\\n\\nOLDER SOLDIER\\n\\nSmugglers have been using this road \\nto take weapons to our enemies. \\n\\nIN THE WOODS - THE YOUNG SOLDIER,\\n\\nReturns with an arm load of fire wood…\\n\\nAT THE CHECKPOINT\\n\\n\\x0c2.\\n\\nThe Older Soldier approaches the wagons. \\n\\nCARAVAN LEADER\\n\\nWe take no sides in your wars.\\n\\nOLDER SOLDIER\\n\\nNevertheless, my orders are to \\ninspect all cargo. \\n\\nCARAVAN LEADER\\n\\nIf you insist…\\n\\nThe Older Soldier pulls back the canvas tarp covering one of \\nthe wagons.  It is filled with SWORDS, SHIELDS and ARMAMENTS.\\n\\nThe Soldier’s eyes go wide.  He wheels around…\\n\\nIn a flash the CARAVAN LEADER plunges a SCIMITAR into his \\nstomach!\\n\\nON THE YOUNG SOLDIER,\\n\\nArriving just in time to see his comrade slain.  The \\nSMUGGLERS leap onto their horses and ride off. \\n\\nA beat.  He drops the firewood and races to the guard hut.  \\nHe lifts a RAM’S HORN to his lips and blows with all his \\nmight.  \\n\\nA long powerful note carries over to…\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT\\n\\nThe SMUGGLERS whip their horses mercilessly.  A wagon wheel \\nhits a rock and pitches over, spilling blades and shields.\\n\\nLEADER\\n\\nLeave it!\\n\\nWE HEAR a growing thunder in the distance.  Horsemen riding \\nhard.  The smugglers redouble their pace on the perilous \\nroad. \\n\\nBut the Persian SOLDIERS are closing furiously.  An arrow \\nwhistles past.  The smugglers abandon their caravan now and \\nsimply flee for their lives.\\n\\nIt’s no use.  In moments, the squad of Persian SOLDIERS is on \\ntop of them.  Swords, hooves and men clash on the narrow \\nmountain road. \\n\\n\\x0c3.\\n\\nA torch is knocked to the ground-- a smuggler’s horse rears \\nup at the flames.  The rider loses control and topples, \\nscreaming into the canyon below…\\n\\nThe Leader sees his fellows fall and wheels his horse to make \\na break for it.  He strikes down a Persian soldier from \\nbehind and charges past.\\n\\nAs he gallops away, the YOUNG SOLDIER from the outpost leaps \\nfrom his saddle and draws his bow.  He squints, aims and… \\nTHWWWWWWIP! fires into the darkness.  \\n\\nThe soldiers peer into the gloom.  A beat.  Then the \\nriderless horse trots back into view.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - LATER\\n\\nSeveral Persian SOLDIERS stand over the body of the Lead \\nSmuggler.\\n\\nYOUNG SOLDIER\\n\\nAttention!   \\n\\nThe soldiers turn and bow as NIZAM (gray beard, wise face) \\nrides up, flanked by two guards.  His fine clothes and armor \\nreflect the fact that he’s a member of the ROYAL FAMILY. \\n\\nNizam nods to the Young Soldier.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nAt ease.  You did well to stop \\nthese smugglers.\\n\\nNizam dismounts and approaches the body of the Lead Smuggler.  \\nHe rolls him over with his foot and notices something around \\nthe dead man’s neck.  Nizam lifts it up:  a LEATHER SATCHEL.\\n\\nINT. ROYAL PERSIAN ARMY TENT - NIGHT\\n\\nTorchlight illuminates the richly appointed tent filled with \\ntapestries, silk carpets and burnished gold.  \\n\\nPrince TUS, (the eldest son, a fierce, battle-hardened \\ncommander) sits at the head of the table.  Next are the \\ntwins, FARHAD and FARHAN (identical, equally fastidious \\naristocrats).   \\n\\nA banquet is served.  Tus glances at an empty chair.\\n\\n\\x0c4.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nWhere is he?\\n\\nThe TWINS shrug in unison.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS the sound of \\nmen’s voices out the doorway of the tent toward… \\n\\nEXT. ARMY CAMP - NIGHT\\n\\nThe COMMON SOLDIERS are spread out over the rough terrain \\nbelow.  Men carouse, laugh and drink around the campfires.\\n\\nWE DRIFT TOWARD a group of soldiers clustered around a young \\nMAN lining up to throw a dagger at a crude target.  Shouts \\nfrom the onlookers:  “He won’t make it this time…  Come on \\nDastan… Shut up and let him concentrate…” etc.\\n\\nDASTAN (early 20s, the slim bearing of a natural athlete) \\npays no attention.  He has a quiet, calm, confidence that \\nsets him apart from the others.\\n\\nIn one quick, fluid motion he throws…  KA-THUNK.  Bull’s eye.\\n\\nCheers and groans from the crowd.  Money changes hands as \\nside bets are collected.\\n\\nDastan accepts a drink of ale.  Somebody fetches his dagger \\nfor him.  He puts it away. \\n\\nA hulking, scary-looking SOLDIER steps drunkenly toward him.\\n\\nHULKING SOLDIER\\nYou have to take one more throw.  \\nI’m down a month’s wages.\\n\\nDastan puts a sympathetic hand on the brute’s shoulder.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou bet against me, didn’t you \\nGargor?\\n\\nGARGOR\\n\\n(ashamed)\\n\\nIt won’t happen again. \\n\\nHe turns and tosses his coin purse on the rough table.\\n\\nGARGOR (CONT’D)\\nMy entire purse says Dastan makes \\nthe next throw.  Who will take the \\nbet?\\n\\n\\x0c5.\\n\\nA soldier shouts out:\\n\\nSOLDIER\\n\\nOnly if he throws from farther; \\nmake it fifteen paces!\\n\\nAn “ooooh” goes up from the crowd.  Fifteen is a long throw.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhy not twenty?\\n\\nWhistles and catcalls:  twenty is a really long throw.  Money \\nflies onto the table to match Gargor’s.   \\n\\nGARGOR\\n\\n(nervous)\\n\\nCan you hit the target from that \\nfar? \\n\\nDASTAN \\nI’ve never tried. \\n\\n(smiles)\\n\\nBut if I do you’re going to clean \\nup.\\n\\nThe distance is marked off.  It’s twice the last throw.  \\nDastan takes another drink, enjoying himself.\\n\\nHe steps to the line.  A hush falls.  He flips the dagger in \\nhis hand, concentrating like a pitcher on the mound.  \\n\\nDastan takes aim, throws…  KA-CHUNK!  The dagger sticks in \\nthe target dead center.  A perfect throw.\\n\\nThe MEN erupt.  Gargor lifts Dastan in a bear hug.  Then…\\n\\nHERALD (O.S.)\\n\\nPrince Dastan…  Prince Dastan!\\n\\nThe HERALD reins in his horse.  The celebration quiets down \\nas they notice him.  Gargor sets Dastan down.\\n\\nHERALD (CONT'D)\\nPrince Dastan, your brothers summon \\nyou.\\n\\nDastan brushes himself off.  He bows to the common soldiers \\nwith mock formality.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nGentlemen…\\xa0I take my leave of you. \\n\\n\\x0c6.\\n\\nThey laugh as he swings himself onto the Herald’s horse and \\ngallops off.\\n\\nINT. PERSIAN ARMY TENT - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan takes his place beside his older brothers.  He looks \\nnoticeably rougher around the edges.  The Twins sniff.\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\n(whispers)\\n\\nHave you thought of bathing \\nrecently, Dastan?\\n\\nDastan starts to reply but Tus snaps at them.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nSilence.  Our uncle has important \\nnews.\\n\\nNizam approaches and sets down the LEATHER SATCHEL he found \\non the smuggler.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nNoble Princes, we have won many \\nvictories in these wars.  But we \\nhave been unable to completely cut \\noff our enemy’s supply lines.  \\nTonight our sentries intercepted \\nyet another smuggler’s caravan \\nfilled with weapons.  \\n\\nHe pulls a sheaf of parchment from the LEATHER SATCHEL.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\n\\nBut this time, we have captured \\npapers that tell us the identity of \\nour enemy’s secret ally.\\n\\nThe four PRINCES crane to see.   \\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\nIt is the kingdom of Alamut that \\nhas been arming our foe.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\n(frowns)\\n\\nAlamut?  Our father, the King, has \\nalways said it was a Holy City.  \\nNot to be touched.\\n\\n\\x0c7.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nThat is because your father did not \\nknow the truth.  \\n\\nNizam points to a map with Arabic calligraphy.  \\n\\nNIZAM (CONT’D)\\nAlamut is two days hence.  If you \\nwish to strike before we march \\nhomeward, now is your opportunity. \\n\\nFarhan clears his throat-- his brother speaks:\\n\\nFARHAD\\nDoes Alamut have treasure?\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nHe’s only asking because it has \\nbeen a long campaign…\\n\\nFARHAD\\nWe’re thinking of the men.\\n\\nExactly.\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nTreasure.  Food.  Beautiful women.  \\nAlamut is renowned for them. \\n\\nOur father did not send us to fight \\nfor plunder.  Nor did he send us to \\nfight Alamut.\\n\\nWell said, Dastan.  But the friend \\nof our enemy is our enemy.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nMy father taught me when you cut \\ndown a tree, you must pluck up the \\nroot.  \\n\\n(looks to Nizam)\\n\\nI’ll need evidence to convince my \\nfather that Alamut has taken our \\nenemy’s side.\\n\\nTus deliberates.\\n\\n\\x0c8.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nThe evidence lies within the walls \\nof Alamut itself:  secret forges, \\nswords, spears…  but Alamut is a \\nmighty Citadel.  It has never \\nfallen, Prince Tus.\\n\\nHe bows deeply.  Tus makes his decision.  \\n\\nTUS\\n\\nIt has never faced an army like \\nours.\\n\\nEXT. ROCKY SLOPE - SUNRISE\\n\\nWE HEAR the metallic clink of armor, the thud of boots on \\nhard ground and horses…   The morning fog clears TO REVEAL\\n\\nTHE PERSIAN ARMY on the move.\\n\\nThousands of men and horses.  Catapults, cavalry, archers.  A \\nstunning, fearsome sight.\\n\\nAhead, in the shadow of the mountain, a massive fortress \\nrises from the mist like the home of the gods…\\n\\nTHE CITADEL OF ALAMUT.  Ancient, mysterious and impregnable.\\n\\nThe common soldiers at Dastan’s side look shaken and make \\nsuperstitious gestures to ward off evil.\\n\\nFEARFUL SOLDIER\\nThey say the Alamut are sorcerers.  \\nBlack magic.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI expect they’re flesh and bone, \\nlike us.\\n\\nDastan rides ahead to join his older brothers on the ridge, \\ncompleting a quartet of horsemen.\\n\\nThe PRINCES gaze at Alamut for the first time.\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nWe’re going to get dirty, aren’t \\nwe?\\n\\n\\x0c9.\\n\\nYou only get dirty if you actually \\nfight.  Do that and I’ll polish \\nyour armor for you.\\n\\n(looks Dastan up and down)\\nYou’d do better to polish your own.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nCome.  Let’s make our father proud.\\n\\nThey gallop off.\\n\\nINT. BEDROOM IN ROYAL PALACE - SUNRISE\\n\\nGossamer curtains billow in the breeze.  A girl tosses in \\nfitful sleep.  Smooth limbs, long black hair -- the darkness \\noffers only a tantalizing hint of the beauty that is TAMINA.\\n\\nA GONG rings out.  Tamina awakens, alarmed.\\n\\nEXT. RAMPARTS - SUNRISE\\n\\nA SENTRY beats a giant GONG.  ALAMUT SOLDIERS run past \\nshouting in Foreign.\\n\\nEXT. BELOW THE CITADEL - SUNRISE\\n\\nTHE PERSIAN ARMY charges up the wide shaly slope.   \\n\\nTus, galloping ahead, lifts his sword and lets out a WAR CRY.  \\nFrom the ranks rises a blood-curdling NOISE as thousands of \\nvoices join him.  Then…\\n\\nA FLAMING ARROW is fired from the ramparts.  All eyes turn \\nskyward to follow its arc.\\n\\nAt its apex, the arrow suddenly EXPLODES into a shower of \\nbrilliant white fireworks, illuminating the attacking army.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nAT THE WALLS\\n\\nIs mesmerized; the Persians have never seen gunpowder before.\\n\\nSuddenly an ARROW fells the man next to him.  Dastan \\ninstinctively raises his shield, blocking another ARROW.\\n\\n\\x0c10.\\n\\nThe first wave of Persian footsoldiers reaches the citadel.  \\nLadders are thrown up; men scale the walls--\\n\\nALAMUT SOLDIERS rise from the ramparts to repel them with \\narrows, pole-axes and burning oil.  A classic medieval siege.\\n\\nON THE BATTLEFIELD\\n\\nThe second wave of Persians prepares to advance when \\nsuddenly…\\xa0they start being picked off by arrows!\\n\\nDastan spots the problem -- ALAMUT SABOTEURS clad in black, \\nlike ninjas, have emerged from secret hiding places in the \\nrocks on either side of them.  \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nThe enemy among us!\\n\\nDastan gallops toward a SABOTEUR who’s just doused a Persian \\ncatapult with oil to burn it.  Leaping from horseback onto \\nthe catapult, Dastan strikes the torch from the man’s hand \\nbefore he can light it.\\n\\nThey clash swords.  The Saboteur, an intimidating spectre \\nswathed in black is a formidable swordsman.  But Dastan holds \\nhis own with surprising skill.\\n\\nA SECOND SABOTEUR joins in.  Despite Dastan’s speed and \\nagility, the two Saboteurs inexorably force him up onto the \\ncatapult platform.  While #1 keeps him busy, #2 lights a \\ntorch.  The catapult BURSTS INTO FLAMES.\\n\\nDastan battles on with determination, heedless of the FLAMES \\nrising around him.  At last he turns the tables and knocks \\nboth Saboteurs off the platform into the flames.\\n\\nA moment of satisfaction…\\n\\nThen Dastan sees the TIE ROPE burning.  Uh oh.  He looks \\ndown, realizes what he’s standing on…\\n\\nJust as the ROPE BURNS THROUGH.\\n\\nThe catapult arm FLINGS Dastan into the air.  He soars toward \\nthe ramparts…\\n\\nEXT. RAMPARTS - DAY\\n\\nAlamut SOLDIERS, fighting off the invaders, look up to see an \\nenemy soldier hurtling toward them like a cannonball.\\n\\n\\x0c11.\\n\\nWhizzing over their heads, Dastan makes a desperate grab at a \\npassing canvas awning.  It RIPS -- but slows his flight as he \\ntears through a series of canvas awnings, one after another.\\n\\nDastan’s amazed he’s survived until…\\n\\nHe runs out of awnings.  Confronted with a FATAL DROP to the \\nnext rampart, he saves himself by grabbing the torn canvas of \\nthe last awning.\\n\\nOn the rampart below, a trio of ARCHERS take aim.  Dastan \\ndangles in space, a prime target.\\n\\nPushing off the stone wall with his feet, he struggles to \\nclimb the torn canvas.  The first volley of arrows barely \\nmisses him.  Dastan climbs faster.  As he nears the top…\\n\\nThe canvas RIPS -- dropping him further than before and \\nSLAMMING him into the wall.  (Thanks to which, the second \\nvolley misses him too.)\\n\\nDastan gets a new idea.  He starts to “run” back and forth \\nalong the wall, swinging on the canvas to gain momentum.\\n\\nThe cloth RIPS more.  Not good.  He’s hanging by a thread.\\n\\nHis eye is on a nearby parapet:  if he can swing to it…\\n\\nEXT. CITADEL GATE - DAY\\n\\nPersian soldiers on the narrow bridge leading to the citadel \\nrun a BATTERING RAM into the iron gate.  Heave-ho!  BAM!\\n\\nAnd again.  BAM!  The battering ram SMASHES through the gate.  \\nThe triumphant horde storms through the vaulted entrance--\\n\\nOnly to find themselves confronted by a SECOND GATE!  A \\nTORRENT OF ARROWS is unleashed on them from above.  They’re \\ntrapped by the men rushing in; it’s a slaughter. \\n\\nEXT. RAMPART - DAY\\n\\nRunning on the wall, Dastan swings almost within reach of the \\nparapet… just misses it.  He swings back the other way; an \\nARROW grazes him.\\n\\nBelow him, two more ARCHERS join the firing squad.  They load \\ntheir bows.\\n\\n\\x0c12.\\n\\nWith determination, Dastan backs up as far as he can for the \\nfinal swing, the one that has to make it…\\n\\nAs he’s swinging toward the parapet, his canvas “rope” \\nBREAKS.  Dastan sails through the air…\\n\\nGrabs for the parapet… misses it… plummets toward earth…\\n\\nAnd, brilliantly, saves himself by grabbing a window ledge \\nbelow.  Scrambles through, just escaping a hail of ARROWS.\\n\\nINT. GUARD TOWER - DAY\\n\\nDastan lands in a stone corridor.  FIVE ALAMUT SOLDIERS \\nconverge on him.  He draws his sword.\\n\\nAnd now we see Dastan fighting in his element.  His style is \\nmedieval Parkour.  [Parkour is a blend of extreme sport and \\nmartial art developed on the streets of Paris.]  Dastan uses \\nwalls, railings, statuary-- anything he can bounce, grab or \\nroll off of for an advantage.  Fighting him is like trying to \\ngrab hold of a bar of soap.  \\n\\nDastan runs to the edge, looks down over the parapet.\\n\\nHIS POV:  The main bridge below, clogged with soldiers.\\n\\nBeside him, thick rope cables rise from an open SHAFT.\\n\\nALAMUT SOLDIER (IN FOREIGN)\\n\\nStop him!\\n\\nAs the soldiers descend on him, Dastan jumps onto the main \\nCABLE and does a fireman’s slide to the platform below.\\n\\nINT. GUARD CONTROL ROOM - DAY\\n\\nDastan lands; GUARDS rush him.  He flips one, sends the next \\nplummeting down the shaft -- grabs a crank lever--\\n\\nALAMUT SOLDIER (IN FOREIGN)\\n\\nNO!!\\n\\nDastan THROWS the lever, releasing the crank, which TURNS--\\n\\nEXT. CITADEL ENTRANCE - DAY\\n\\nA CHEER erupts from the horde of Persian soldiers as the GATE \\nRAISES.  Men pour into the citadel.\\n\\n\\x0c13.\\n\\nOUTSIDE THE GATE\\n\\nTUS stares in disbelief as the bridge empties of men.\\n\\nTUS\\nTo the bridge!\\n\\nFROM ALL SIDES, soldiers pour onto the narrow bridge.\\n\\nINT. BEDROOM IN ROYAL PALACE - DAY\\n\\nTamina gazes out the window.  A HANDMAID bursts in.\\n\\nHANDMAID\\nMy Lady!  We must flee!  The \\ninvaders have breached the gate!  \\n\\nTAMINA\\nWhat?  How did this happen? \\n\\nHANDMAID\\n\\nThere is no time-- you must save \\nyourself!\\n\\nTAMINA \\n\\nThere is far more at stake than my \\nsafety. \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\nSend word to collapse the passages \\nto the Hourglass.  And have the \\ndagger brought to me. \\n\\nHANDMAID\\n\\nYes my lady.\\n\\nThe Handmaid bows her head in acknowledgment.  Tamina remains \\ncalm and self-possessed.\\n\\nEXT. CITADEL MAIN COURTYARD - DAY\\n\\nA courtyard of austere and exotic Eastern beauty.  At the far \\nend stands a temple with a sacred FOUNTAIN guarded by stone \\nlions -- all carved out of a massive block of pure white \\nmarble.\\n\\nA flood of Persian soldiers soon overwhelms the defenders.\\n\\n\\x0c14.\\n\\nEXT. CITY STREETS - DAY\\n\\nCivilians flee screaming through narrow stone streets.\\n\\nEXT. INSIDE THE CITADEL - DAY\\n\\nThe twins fight side by side without breaking a sweat.\\n\\nNizam rides through the enemy troops wielding two swords at \\nonce with a deadly dexterity surprising for a man his age.\\n\\nTus, hacking his way to victory, pauses -- \\n\\nTUS\\n\\nWhere’s Dastan?\\n\\nEXT. ANOTHER RAMPART - DAY\\n\\nDastan emerges onto a quiet rampart -- a narrow trench \\nbetween two high walls.  The battle has not yet reached this \\npart of the castle.\\n\\nA FLASH OF LIGHT catches Dastan’s eye…  he looks up at an \\narched window where somebody is signalling with a small hand \\nmirror…\\xa0a fleeting glimpse of a beautiful female silhouette \\nbehind a sheer curtain:  Tamina.\\n\\nThen…  HOOFBEATS.  Dastan turns to see a mighty ALAMUT \\nWARRIOR galloping toward him on an armored stallion.\\n\\nDastan’s trapped between the walls.  The corridor is too \\nnarrow for him to escape.  He’s about to be trampled.\\n\\nThe WARRIOR draws a scimitar…\\n\\nAt the last instant Dastan runs straight up the wall-- pushes \\noff with a backflip and lands ON THE HORSE! \\n\\nThe two men GRAPPLE on horseback.  Sparks fly as armor and \\nweapons scrape the stone walls at full gallop.\\n\\nThey fight -- Dastan getting the worst of it as his more \\nheavily-armored opponent pounds him mercilessly.  The Alamut \\nwarrior raises his sword to finish Dastan once and for all…\\n\\nDastan throws his arms around the warrior’s waist, dragging \\nhim from the saddle.  The two men crash to the ground.\\n\\n\\x0c15.\\n\\nAs they roll to a halt and fall apart WE SEE that Dastan has \\nmanaged to turn the warrior’s blade at the last second-- so \\nthat he has been impaled on impact instead of Dastan.\\n\\nThe warrior is dying, but with the last of his strength he \\nreaches for something tucked into his waistband…  Dastan \\nprepares to defends himself, then realizes he’s in no danger.  \\n\\nThe warrior clutches a cloth-wrapped bundle in his hand.  He \\ntries to speak.  Dastan cranes closer to hear his last words… \\nToo late.  He’s dead.\\n\\nTAMINA’S POV - from a window above she looks down and sees \\nDastan kneeling over the body. \\n\\nThe warrior’s fingers uncurl, the bundle slips from his hand \\nand out rolls… a ceremonial DAGGER with a glass handle \\nencrusted with precious stones.  Ancient and otherwordly, as \\nif it had been made by the gods, not men.\\n\\nDastan picks it up.  The glass handle is half-filled with a \\nfine white sand, so naturally bright it glows.  Dastan tilts \\nit curiously, the way you might tilt an hourglass.\\n\\nDastan tucks the dagger in his belt, a war trophy.\\n\\nON TAMINA - her eyes burn with fury as she watches. Dastan’s \\nclothes are charred and torn from his escapades.  She did not \\nsee him slay the warrior and thus takes him for the lowest \\nsort of thief, one who loots the bodies of the dead for easy \\nplunder.\\n\\nEXT. CITADEL MAIN COURTYARD - DAY\\n\\nDastan emerges and spots his brothers conferring with Nizam \\namidst the crowd of soldiers.  He approaches.\\n\\nDastan.  Where have you been?\\n\\nTus, I opened the gate!\\n\\nTus, in a bad mood, snaps--\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nEvery man here played his part.  \\nDon’t take credit for their \\nbravery.\\n\\nThe Twins snicker at Dastan.  Tus turns back to the others.\\n\\n\\x0c16.\\n\\nTUS (CONT’D)\\n\\nNo word yet on the secret armories?\\n\\nThe search has only just begun, \\nPrince Tus.  If you like, I will \\nstay behind and continue to look--\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nNo.  I’m not going back to face my \\nfather without proof.  I’ll stay to \\nconduct the search for these \\nweapons myself.\\n\\nThere is an edge to his voice that warns them not to argue.\\n\\nEXT. GATES OF ALAMUT - DAY\\n\\nPersian soldiers load horse and camel drawn wagons with \\nlooted gold and treasure in preparation for the journey home.\\n\\nAlamut prisoners are sorted into groups and selected as \\nslaves for transport.\\n\\nAn OFFICER inspects a group of captive YOUNG WOMEN.  Among \\nthem is Tamina, her fine dress concealed under a drab cloak.\\n\\nTamina keeps her head down.  The officer lifts her chin to \\nget a good look at her face.\\n\\nOFFICER\\n\\nLet’s see your hands.\\n\\nTamina shows one hand.  The Officer yanks the other into \\nview. WE SEE that she has palmed her ornate RING, slipping it \\nunnoticed into the folds of her cloak.  The OFFICER herds her \\ninto a line of captives being loaded onto a wagon.\\n\\nAT THE HEAD OF THE CARAVAN\\n\\nDASTAN packs his horse’s saddlebags.  His brother approaches.\\n\\nWhere is your share of the \\ntreasure, Dastan?\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI fight for glory, not for plunder.\\n\\n\\x0c17.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nThat’s very noble, younger brother, \\nbut what gift will you bring to our \\nfather?\\n\\nDastan hesitates; he hadn’t thought of that.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nOur father doesn’t expect gifts \\nfrom me…\\n\\nThe Twins pause from overseeing the mountain of gold and \\ncoins being loaded onto their wagons to laugh at Dastan.   \\n\\nTus silences them with a look.  He turns sternly to Dastan.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nIt’s not about what he expects; \\nit’s about showing proper respect.  \\nYou’re no longer a child, Dastan.\\n\\nTus walks over to one of his own wagons and selects a \\ngorgeous, embroidered silk ROBE.   He hands it to Dastan. \\n\\nTUS (CONT'D)\\nBe a good son.  Give him this.    \\n\\nThe twins roll their eyes-- there goes Tus, bailing Dastan \\nout.  Nizam on the other hand, watches approvingly.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(grateful)\\nThank you brother.\\n\\nEXT. CENTRAL ASIAN VALLEY - [ANOTHER] DAY\\n\\nThe caravan of Persian SOLDIERS, HORSES and CAMELS wends its \\nway down from the mountains, into the plain.\\n\\nDastan sits backward in his saddle, reading a book.  Nizam \\nrides up alongside.\\n\\nYour brother is right, you know.  \\nYou shouldn’t come home from a \\nbattle empty-handed.   \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI didn’t come away empty-handed.  \\n\\n\\x0cHe shows Nizam the DAGGER with the glass handle.  Nizam \\ninspects it with interest.  Hands it back.\\n\\n18.\\n\\nDastan puts away his book and turns around in the saddle.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nVery nice.  But you should consider \\nyour future, Dastan.  \\n\\n(a touch of bitterness)\\n\\nYou were unlucky in birth-- like \\nme, born last.  Those of us not \\ndestined to inherit our fortune \\nmust earn it.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI am more interested in great deeds \\nand adventure than great fortune, \\nuncle.\\n\\nYou’ve had plenty of both on this \\ncampaign.\\n\\nHardly the stuff of legend.  We win \\nbecause we have my father’s army.  \\nThe army he built, with his life’s \\nblood, starting from nothing.  That \\nwas an accomplishment.   \\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nDo you know what I want?  To set \\nforth from home with no army, just \\none horse and a good sword, and no \\none knowing I am the son of \\nShahraman.  Then my achievements \\nmay be small-- but they’ll be mine.  \\nAnd I can bring them home to him \\nwith pride.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n(with a twinkle)\\n\\nDastan, I have misjudged you.  I \\nthought you the most modest of my \\nnephews.  In fact, you are the most \\nambitious.\\n\\nNizam winks at him and spurs his horse onward.\\n\\nHe leans toward Nizam and lowers his voice, his eyes burning \\nwith excitement.\\n\\n\\x0c19.\\n\\nEXT. NASAF - SUNSET\\n\\nThe sun sets behind the gleaming spires and domes of the \\nroyal city of NASAF.  TILT DOWN to REVEAL the dusty caravan \\nfinally arriving home.\\n\\nThe returning soldiers are met by a cheering crowd.\\n\\nThe Captain of the Guards, GARSIV (a young hotshot) stands at \\nattention for the returning nobles.  His expression sours \\nwhen Dastan comes abreast of him:  the two are about the same \\nage, and clearly have some history.  \\n\\nNo injuries, Dastan?  Didn’t your \\nbrothers let you fight? \\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nHardly at all, Garsiv.  I’m very \\nrusty; maybe you’ll be able to beat \\nme in the tournament this year.  \\nFinally.\\n\\nDastan smiles tauntingly and rides past.\\n\\nINT. BANQUET HALL - LATER\\n\\nA magnificent eighth century palace with high vaulted \\nceilings and tiled mosaics.\\n\\nMusicians play flutes and tambourines, beautiful slaves \\ncirculate, serving delicacies to the guests (all male), \\nseated on cushions at low tables.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nIs part of a group of newbie SLAVE GIRLS being prepped by a \\nstern MATRON who makes last minute adjustments to each girl’s \\n(scanty) attire before sending her out with an hors d’oeuvre \\ntray.\\n\\nThe Matron frowns at Tamina’s outfit, tugs at it to reveal \\nmore cleavage.  Tamina, indignant, seems about to slap her -- \\nthen remembering where she is, submits.  Her face burns as \\nthe Matron sends her forth with a pat on the ass.\\n\\nFOLLOW the slave girls as they mix into the crowd… and MOVE \\nPAST them, to a roped-off royal dais where…\\n\\n\\x0cTears into a chicken leg with gusto.  The Twins, eating with \\nelegant delicacy shoot him twin looks of disgust.\\n\\n20.\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou eat like a common foot-soldier.\\n\\nFoot-soldiers know how to enjoy a \\ngood meal when they get one.  \\nBismillah.\\n\\nDastan halts mid-bite as he sees…\\n\\nTAMINA across the room.  He is mesmerized by the sight of \\nher.  He drops his chicken and starts toward her…\\n\\nON TAMINA\\n\\nAs she struggles under the weight of the tray.  It is \\nunexpectedly lifted from her hands by:\\n\\nWith a flourish, he swings the tray to a nearby table, comes \\nup with two goblets of wine and offers one to her…\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nAllow me…  \\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nI’m Dastan.\\n\\nHer eyes go wide with recognition; he interprets her reaction \\nas fear of being caught chatting with a guest.\\n\\nDastan laughs modestly, not comprehending a word.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nDon’t worry, you won’t get in \\ntrouble for talking to me.  I’m the \\nKing’s son.\\n\\nTAMINA (IN FOREIGN)\\n\\nI have seen you before, you son of \\na dog.   I curse your eyes.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nPlease-- there’s no need to thank \\nme.  You’ve been working hard, you \\ndeserve a rest.  \\n(leans close)\\n\\nJust for the record, I don’t \\nsupport the practice of enslaving \\nthe people we conquer.  \\n\\n(MORE)\\n\\n\\x0cDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nPersonally I think it’s an old-\\nfashioned and barbaric custom…    \\n\\nTamina’s eyes go to the DAGGER in his belt…\\n\\n21.\\n\\nTAMINA (IN FOREIGN)\\n\\nYou steal from the dead and deface \\nwhat is holy.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\n…nor should you let the fact that \\nI’m a Prince intimidate you.  I’m \\nsure it sounds very impressive but \\nI’m only a fourth son––\\n\\nA FANFARE of TRUMPETS signals the start of the royal \\nprocession.  Everybody surges forward to look; Dastan and \\nTamina are separated in the crowd… \\n\\nKING SHAHRAMAN enters with his entourage.  Gray-bearded and \\nbroad-shouldered, his very presence commands respect.  All \\nbow deeply as he passes.\\n\\nShahraman sits and the others take their places on the dias \\naccording to rank.  Garsiv stands sentry behind the throne.  \\nTamina creeps closer through the crowd for a better view.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\n(embracing Nizam)\\n\\nMy dear brother!  Your wise counsel \\nhas brought us victory.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nNo, it is your sons who have \\nbrought honor and glory to the \\nbanner of Nasaf.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\n(looks around)\\nWhere is my eldest son?\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nTus has remained to bring order to \\nthe lands conquered in your name.  \\nHis brothers will convey his \\ngreetings to you.\\n\\nThe Twins step forward with elaborately ceremonial, \\nsimultaneous bows -- a bit over the top for Shahraman.\\n\\n\\x0c22.\\n\\nMy lord and father, to see you is \\nlike seeing the sun after the \\nlongest night of winter.  Our noble \\nbrother has entrusted me--\\n\\nUs.\\n\\n--has entrusted us with gifts.\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nFARHAN\\nAnd I bring gifts as well.\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nWe.\\n\\nWe bring gifts.\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nOn cue, TEN SLAVES enter bearing ten gold platters laden with \\njewels, their powerful muscles straining under the weight.\\n\\nTwenty more slaves parade in, bearing twenty golden platters \\npiled even higher than the first.\\n\\nFARHAN (CONT'D)\\nOver treacherous mountains, across \\nthe burning desert, we carried the \\ntreasure--\\n\\n--his as well as ours--\\n\\n-- out of love for you.\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nThe Twins bow deeply.\\n\\nAnd your youngest son waits to \\ngreet you as well.\\n\\nShahraman breaks into a smile on seeing Dastan; he has a \\nspecial fondness for this son.  Dastan throws himself into \\nhis dad’s embrace, hugs him hard.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\nDastan.  What mischief have you \\nbeen up to?\\n\\n\\x0c23.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFather, I’ve brought you a gift.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\n(affectionately)\\n\\nDo you mean to say you haven’t lost \\nit or gambled it away?\\n\\nDastan beckons to a pretty FEMALE SLAVE who appears carrying \\na cloth bundle -- and in a nifty move, shakes it out, \\nunveiling the ROBE OF HONOR.  Everyone oohs.\\n\\nShahraman takes the robe.  Runs his fingers over the gold-\\nembroidered silk.  He’s genuinely surprised and touched.\\n\\nAttendants remove Shahraman’s robe and help him don the new \\none.  The Twins seethe with jealousy at such favoritism.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nDastan, this is unlike you.  I \\nshall wear it with pride.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN (CONT’D)\\n\\nFrom which of a our conquered \\nkingdoms does this come?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFrom Alamut, father.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\nAlamut?\\n\\nShahraman’s face flushes with anger.  He turns--\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nNizam!  You let them attack Alamut?\\n\\nTamina watches with special interest as Nizam steps forward.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nSire, if you’ll hear me out--\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN \\n\\nYou know that the kingdom of Alamut \\nis sacred!  That it is forbidden to \\nattack it!  Why were my orders \\ndisobeyed?! \\n\\nNizam hangs his head at the rebuke.\\n\\n\\x0cThe new robe suddenly seems to itch Shahraman; he tugs at it \\nirritably.\\n\\n24.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN (CONT’D)\\n\\nSpeak!\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nO King, we were provoked…\\xa0 we \\ndiscovered evidence that Alamut was \\nsecretly supporting our enemy-- is \\nsomething wrong, sire?\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\nThis robe is hot.  What evidence?\\n\\nWe intercepted a smuggler’s \\ncaravan.  The weapons came from-- \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFather?\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\nTake off the robe!\\n\\nAttendants hasten to remove the robe, but cannot.  It won’t \\ncome off-- it’s glued to his skin.  Shahraman ROARS in pain.\\n\\nShahraman lurches to his feet.  Like a maddened bull, he \\nshakes off his attendants, tearing at the robe.  STEAM hisses \\nfrom the burning places where it STICKS to his flesh.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFather!!\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nIt’s poisoned!\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN\\n\\nTake it off!\\n\\nEvery one is shocked and horrified.  Dastan hurtles to his \\nfather’s side.  Catches him as he falls, staining his own \\nclothes with blood.  Shahraman is dying in agony, with third \\ndegree burns all over his body.\\n\\nSHAHRAMAN (CONT'D)\\n\\n…my son?\\n\\nGarsiv rushes to help his king.  He shoves Dastan aside.\\n\\n\\x0c25.\\n\\nGARSIV\\nYou’ve killed your father!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhat?  No!  I--\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\n(shouts)\\n\\nPrince Dastan has killed the king! \\n\\nGuards rip Dastan away from Shahraman.  While he struggles, \\nGarsiv and other guards attempt to remove the King’s robe, \\nbut only intensify his death agony.\\n\\nGarsiv lowers Shahraman’s dead body to the ground.  He draws \\nhis sword and points it at Dastan.\\n\\nThe Twins draw their swords as well.  All eyes are on Dastan.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(fighting to break free)\\n\\nFATHER!!!\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nMurderer!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(choking back tears)\\n\\nI didn’t do this!   \\n\\n(looks around desperately)\\n\\nNizam!  Tell them…\\n\\nNizam looks at him with shocked disappointment.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nThat is for a tribunal to decide, \\nDastan. \\n\\nThe guards begin to drag Dastan from the room.  Tamina edges \\nforward…\\n\\nWith a sudden, desperate burst of strength, Dastan breaks \\nfree.  He snatches a sword from one of the guards, parries \\nthe attack of another and…\\n\\n…escapes through a small doorway behind the dais.\\n\\nIn the confusion, Tamina ducks out unnoticed through the \\ncurtains on the same side of the room.\\n\\n\\x0c26.\\n\\nEXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nDastan runs for his life.  Footsteps and shouts behind him.  \\nAs he races down the hallway he’s suddenly pulled into…\\n\\nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDrags him inside and slams the door shut behind him.   \\n\\nShe throws open the window and tosses a sheet over the ledge, \\nrapidly tying it to another.  She’s all business.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhat are you--?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDastan hesitates.\\n\\nBAM!  BAM!  Soldiers are at the door.   \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nGo.\\n\\nGo!\\n\\nAs Dastan climbs out the window Tamina reaches, like a \\npickpocket, for the DAGGER in his belt…  \\n\\nUnaware, Dastan nimbly slips out the window just before she \\ncan take it. \\n\\nEXT. STABLES - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan slides down the sheet-rope and lands with a thud in a \\npile of hay.  Tamina tumbles down after him.\\n\\nShe leaps to her feet as Dastan struggles to his.  He looks \\naround and sees they are in the stables…\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI don’t even know your name, Slave-\\nGirl, but I thank you for your \\nhelp.  Now you should hide.  I must \\nflee at once and doubtless you \\ncannot even--\\n\\n\\x0c27.\\n\\nTamina mounts a magnificent Arabian THOROUGHBRED and takes \\noff at a gallop.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\n…ride.\\n\\nDastan stares for a moment.  Then the GUARDS burst out of the \\ndoorway.  Dastan leaps onto the nearest available mount-- a \\nsmall and seemingly unimpressive horse-- and spurs it on.\\n\\nIN THE COURTYARD\\n\\nA dozen of the King’s HORSEMEN led by Garsiv ride out, \\ntrapping Tamina and Dastan.\\n\\nThey’re the best-trained, most formidable military unit in \\nPersia.  Normally everyone flees from them.  Instead, Dastan \\nrides straight at them.\\n\\nHe dodges right -- then left -- and slips by:  Magic Johnson \\non horseback.  The resulting moment of disarray lets Tamina \\ncharge past on the other side and out the entrance.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nClose the gate!\\n\\nAs the GUARDS relay Garsiv’s command like an echo, the dozen \\nhorsemen turn around as one to give chase.\\n\\nEXT. PALACE MAIN GATE - NIGHT\\n\\nThe two fugitives gallop toward the great, lowering iron \\ngate, Garsiv’s posse on their heels.\\n\\nTamina’s larger and faster horse gets there first.  Dastan \\ncatches a glimpse of her nimbly swinging sideways in her \\nsaddle to avoid decapitation as she rides under the closing \\ngate.\\n\\nImpressive.  But it looks like the gate will close before \\nDastan gets there.  To make matters worse, four FOOTSOLDIERS \\nrange out in front of it, with spears raised to impale him.\\n\\nDastan’s eyes narrow.  Redoubling his speed, he charges on… \\nand SHATTERS a spear with his sword, opening space to pass.\\n\\nHe swings halfway off his horse and narrowly squeezes \\nthrough.  The gate closes, sealing in Garsiv’s men.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nOpen the gate!!\\n\\n\\x0c28.\\n\\nThe soldiers raise the gate they just closed.  Garsiv’s \\nposse, which has swelled to forty riders, charges through.\\n\\nEXT. CITY IN THE DESERT - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan and Tamina gallop out of the walled city and strike \\nout toward the hills with the king’s men in pursuit.  \\n\\nA full moon illuminates the rough terrain.  Tamina leads the \\nway over a series of increasingly treacherous jumps.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(amazed)\\n\\nWhere did you learn to ride like \\nthat?\\n\\nTwo pursuing horsemen fall jumping the boulders.  The others \\npress closer…\\n\\nAn ARROW whistles past Dastan’s head.  He looks over his \\nshoulder, sees the posse gaining on him.  He urges the little \\nhorse to greater speed but he’s outclassed.\\n\\nInexorably, the first ARCHER draws even with Dastan.  He \\nshoots; Dastan drops from sight!  The archer, seeing Dastan’s \\nhorse riderless, is momentarily confused -- did he hit him?  \\nNo, Dastan is clinging to the saddle on the other side, \\nshielded by the horse’s body.\\n\\nGARSIV\\nShoot the horse!\\n\\nDastan, half upside-down, registers alarm on hearing this.  \\nAs the archer fires, Dastan pops back up in his saddle and \\npulls up the reins -- causing the arrow to miss.\\n\\nDastan escapes into a narrow GULLY, forcing his pursuers to \\nfollow single file.  \\n\\nDescending the steep gully, Dastan discovers the true gift of \\nhis undersized mount -- he’s a mountain horse.  The sure-\\nfooted animal rapidly regains the ground he lost.  Recklessly \\ntackling the treacherous slope, Dastan emerges onto a broad \\nplateau -- ahead of Tamina.\\n\\nDastan’s pursuers benefit from the shortcut as well.  As they \\npour out of the gully they land right on Tamina.  She weaves, \\ntrying to shake them, but can’t escape.\\n\\n\\x0c29.\\n\\nDastan looks back, sees Tamina in trouble.  He slows.  A \\nmistake.  Within moments he too is boxed in by soldiers on \\nall sides.  He can’t get to Tamina.\\n\\nTo Dastan’s left runs the sheer canyon wall.  As his horse \\ndraws up alongside it, he STANDS, perching on the saddle like \\na circus rider -- then RUNS up the wall, using the horse’s \\ngalloping momentum to GRAB an overhanging shrub.  The \\nsoldiers are left herding a riderless horse.\\n\\nDastan launches off the wall and DROPS onto one of the riders \\nharassing Tamina, shoves him out of the saddle and takes his \\nplace.  Drawing his sword, he fights his way toward Tamina, \\nknocking off the soldiers one by one.\\n\\nSuddenly Dastan’s trapped between two riders:  Garsiv on his \\nleft, another on his right.  In a blinding series of sword-\\nclashes, Garsiv forces Dastan to parry repeatedly…  leaving \\nhimself wide open to the soldier on his right.\\n\\nTAMINA\\nDastan, look out!\\n\\nDastan BLOCKS the right-hand soldier’s blow in the nick of \\ntime.  Garsiv turns to see Tamina riding up on his own left.\\n\\nDastan doesn’t waste a moment.  He scrambles across Garsiv’s \\nsaddle and joins Tamina on hers.  Garsiv spins furiously to \\nstop him-- too slow.  \\n\\nThey take off at a gallop.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(to Tamina)\\n\\nYou have more than repaid the small \\nkindness I showed you! \\n\\nBoth halves of the posses are closing in on them.  Up ahead \\nthe plateau drops off in a SHEER CLIFF.\\n\\nDastan spots his small horse running loose.  Taking the reins \\nfrom Tamina, he draws up alongside… and JUMPS into the \\nsaddle.  He reaches out to Tamina.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nCome on!  Jump!\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThis horse is faster!\\n\\n\\x0c30.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYes, but it’s not a mountain horse!  \\nTrust me, jump!\\n\\nTamina hesitates…  then JUMPS from her horse to his.  Dastan \\ncatches her and hauls her up into the saddle.\\n\\nAs the soldiers close in, Dastan turns to face the cliff.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nWhat are you doing?!\\n\\nDastan sets his jaw.  Gallops straight toward the edge --\\n\\nAnd LEAPS out into empty space.\\n\\nThe cliff is not quite sheer, just very steep.  Incredibly, \\nthe horse hits the nearly vertical slope at a gallop -- \\nstraight downhill.\\n\\nAll the King’s horses stop at the edge.  Garsiv, in a frenzy, \\nbeats his horse, urging it on.  But it refuses to continue.\\n\\nDastan and Tamina hang on as the sure-footed mountain horse \\ngallops down, skirting rocks and potholes where a single \\nmisstep could mean death, until they reach the canyon floor.\\n\\nGarsiv, stranded at the top of the cliff, watches in helpless \\nfury as his quarry disappears into the canyon.\\n\\nEXT. CANYON FLOOR - NIGHT\\n\\nTamina sits astride the horse as it drinks from the stream.  \\nDastan kneels by the riverbank a little ways off.  It’s the \\nfirst time he’s had a chance to say a prayer for his father. \\n\\nTamina watches as he wipes his eye, then walks back toward \\nher. \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nI don’t understand; you pray for \\nthe father you murdered? \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(hard)\\n\\nI didn’t murder my father.  I was \\nframed.  \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nYou gave him the poisoned robe…\\n\\n\\x0c31.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n…which my elder brother Tus gave to \\nme.\\n\\nDastan takes some oats from the saddle bag and begins hand \\nfeeding the horse.  Tamina dismounts.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nSo your brother killed him to gain \\nthe throne?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n(shakes his head)\\n\\nMy brother is a good man.  Somebody \\nelse could have poisoned the robe…  \\n\\nWho?  Who else could have done it?\\n\\nThat is the question.  Dastan thinks hard.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nOnly the twins and my uncle Nizam \\nknew of the robe… but my brothers \\nare too stupid and Nizam…\\n(rejects the idea)\\n\\nMy father owed his life to Nizam \\nsince they were young.  They were \\nas close as two brothers could be.  \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(softly)\\nThat leaves you.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nIf that’s what you think then why \\ndid you help me--?\\n\\nDastan is startled, as if he’d forgotten she was there.\\n\\nAs he turns to face her, Tamina swings a SWORD right at him!  \\nDastan dodges by sheer reflex; the blow glances off his \\narmor, sending him sprawling.\\n\\nHe rolls, avoiding a stamping horse’s hoof that would have \\nsplit his skull.  He scrambles to his feet, drawing his sword \\nin time to BLOCK Tamina’s next blow.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nWhat are you doing?!\\n\\n\\x0c32.\\n\\nTamina attacks without mercy.  Dastan, his arm deadened from \\nthe first hit, struggles to defend himself.\\n\\nTamina is good, but not quite a match for Dastan.  With each \\nfailed attack, Dastan recovers ground until Tamina has lost \\nher initial surprise advantage.\\n\\nDastan counter-attacks with blinding speed -- he’s not trying \\nto kill Tamina, just disarm her.  Finally he strikes the \\nsword from her hand.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nWho taught you how to use a sword \\nlike that?\\n\\nTamina surprises him with a KICK in the belly.  Seizing \\nDastan’s arm, she sweeps his legs out from under him.  They \\nhit the ground together, grappling on the riverbank.\\n\\nTamina sees an opening; pulls the dagger from Dastan’s belt.  \\nHe grabs her wrist, flips her.  The dagger goes flying.\\n\\nTamina pushes him off her, scrambles toward the dagger.  \\nDastan gets there first.  He snatches it up--\\n\\nCLICK!  Grasping it, he’s pressed a JEWEL on the dagger’s \\nglass handle.  A trickle of white SAND spills out and lands \\nat his feet.  He looks down surprised…\\n\\nWHAM!!! THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WARPS!\\n\\nTIME slows to a STOP, the dagger frozen in Dastan’s hand.  \\nThe law of physics itself is suspended:  dust and water \\ndroplets hang in midair.  The only element of the scene that \\nremains in motion is the white-glowing sand; as it hits the \\nground, a gust of WIND blows it away…\\n\\nREWIND!!\\n\\nDASTAN,\\n\\nTIME RUNS BACKWARD, reversing the previous action.  Faster \\nand faster -- Tamina and Dastan fight in reverse, their \\nmovements accelerating backward in a BLUR -- until --\\n\\nStaring amazed at the dagger clenched in his hand, suddenly \\nrelaxes his tight grip.  The instant he releases the jewel, \\nthe sand stops pouring out -- and\\n\\nTHE REWIND STOPS\\n\\n\\x0c33.\\n\\nEXT. CANYON FLOOR - NIGHT [SECOND TIME]\\n\\nDastan and Tamina are beside the horse again, as they were \\nthe first time.  Tamina is repeating:\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n…so your brother killed him to gain \\nthe throne?\\n\\nDastan jumps away in confusion and terror, scattering oats.  \\nHe backs away from Tamina as if she’s a witch.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nWhat’s wrong?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou--\\n\\nTurning, he points to the dusty patch of ground where they \\nwere just fighting.  Or were they?\\n\\nTamina is equally perplexed but for a different reason:  she \\ndoes not remember the rewind. Dastan looks down at his empty \\nhand -- then at the dagger, which inexplicably, is back in \\nhis belt…\\n\\nAnd looks up to see Tamina’s SWORD flashing toward him.  \\nDisoriented by what’s happened, Dastan is slower to react \\nthis time; the blade SLASHES him across the chest.  \\n\\nDastan looks down at the spreading stain of BLOOD soaking his \\ntunic.  He takes a step forward; buckles, falls to his knees.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nWho are you?\\n\\nTamina draws herself up imperiously, takes out the RING she’s \\nkept hidden and puts it on her finger.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nI am Tamina, daughter of Sarkander, \\nKing of Alamut.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n(mortally wounded)\\n\\nWhat… magic…?\\n\\nHe looks down at the dagger in his belt.  Draws it.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nGive back what you have stolen.\\n\\n\\x0c34.\\n\\nDastan studies the dagger.  The jewel gleams on its hilt, \\njust above where a hand would normally grasp the dagger.  But \\nif he grasps it this way, as he did when he snatched it up…\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nDon’t!\\n\\nShe makes a grab for the dagger -- Dastan presses the jewel.  \\nCLICK!  Again, sand pours from the handle -- STOPPING TIME.\\n\\nREWIND!! Back through time, reversing the preceding action--\\n\\nThis time, Dastan is more aware of what’s happening.  It’s as \\nif he’s stepped outside himself, outside space and time, into \\na different dimension from which he can watch the rewind.  He \\nlooks down at the dagger in his hand -- just as the last of \\nthe sand drains out, leaving the glass handle empty.\\n\\nEXT. CANYON FLOOR - NIGHT [THIRD TIME]\\n\\nTIME RESUMES a moment before Tamina swings her sword at him.\\n\\nThis time Dastan draws his sword and blocks the blow.  She \\ntries to duel him but he’s the stronger swordsman.  He \\ndisarms her and sends her sprawling to the ground.\\n\\nHe glances down -- to his amazement, his wound has vanished. \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI don’t want to hurt you, but if \\nyou reach for that sword I will \\nstop you before you stab me again.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n“Again?”\\n\\nHer gaze flies to the dagger in Dastan’s belt.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\nThe dagger… you’ve used up all the \\nsand!\\n\\nHow did you know…?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nEverybody from Alamut knows the \\nmyth of that dagger.\\n\\nDastan checks the dagger.  Indeed, its glass handle is empty.  \\n\\n\\x0c35.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhat myth?\\n\\nTamina hesitates, then bows down and changes the subject.\\n\\nTAMINA \\n\\nForgive me for striking at you \\nPrince.  I’m merely a foolish Slave-\\nGirl who sought to escape. \\n\\nDastan looks down, realizing she has no memory of having \\nrevealed her true identity to him:  only the person holding \\nthe DAGGER recalls the re-wind.\\n\\nA smile creeps over Dastan’s face as he watches her grovel.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI will forgive you.  Come, we \\ncannot stay here.  \\n\\nINT. CAVE - LATER\\n\\nTamina sweats, building up the fire while Dastan lounges.\\n\\nHer eyes burn into him:  if looks could kill.  \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nThat’s enough wood.  Come over \\nhere; my boots are dirty. \\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nIs something wrong, Slave-Girl?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(through gritted teeth)\\n\\nNo, my lord.\\n\\nShe kneels to clean his boots.  Dastan examines the dagger.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nA dagger that can turn back time…  \\nwhat else does your legend say? \\n\\nShe scrubs intently at an invisible patch of dirt.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nOnly that it is worthless now that \\nit’s empty.\\n\\nDastan watches her out of the corner of his eye-- he knows \\nshe’s lying.\\n\\n\\x0c36.\\n\\nHe yanks his boot away and marches toward the exit.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nCome.  It will be light soon.  We \\nmust head to Zashad to hire a guide \\nfor the desert crossing.\\n\\nShe scrambles to her feet.\\n\\nEXT. CANYON FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nDastan is already saddling the horse.\\n\\nWhere are we going?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTo Alamut to confront my brother.\\n\\nTamina hurries after Dastan who is already saddling the \\nhorse.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n(a look of panic)\\n\\nAlamut?  But it’s not safe.  If \\nyour older brother did indeed \\npoison that robe–– \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nThen I will find the truth.  About \\nmy brother, about my father’s \\nmurder and about this dagger.  All \\nthe answers are in Alamut.\\n\\nHe tucks the dagger firmly into his waistband.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT’D)\\n\\nUnless there’s more you wish to \\ntell me about it?\\n\\nTamina shakes her head silently.  \\n\\nDASTAN (CONT’D)\\n\\nAs I suspected…\\n\\nDastan picks up her up by the waist and unceremoniously dumps \\nher in the saddle.  She has no time to protest because he \\nthen swings up into the saddle behind her and spurs the \\nhorse. \\n\\n\\x0c37.\\n\\nINT. PALACE OF NASAF - DAY\\n\\nGarsiv strides in, dusty from the chase.  Nizam and the Twins \\nlook up from their conference.\\n\\nAs soon as the words are out of his mouth, Garsiv regrets \\nthem.  His face burns with shame.  \\n\\nMy lords, he has the luck of the \\ndevil himself.\\n\\nWas it his luck or your failure?\\n\\nThe King’s Guards against one \\nsolitary man? \\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nHe wasn’t alone, my Prince; there \\nwas a girl…\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\n(sadly)\\n\\nIf only he hadn’t fled…\\n\\nFARHAD\\nIf he fled then he’s guilty…\\n\\nIf he’s guilty he must be punished.  \\nApprehend him.\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nNIZAM \\n\\nAs you wish, Princes… Garsiv, \\nprepare a full regiment this time.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nRight away, my lord.\\n\\nNIZAM \\n\\nI, myself will accompany the search \\nparty to make sure Prince Dastan is \\ntreated with justice.  \\n\\n(turns to the Twins)\\n\\nTus is our king now.

Nizam notes his eagerness.   \\n\\n\\x0c38.\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\n(delighted)\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nI rule!\\n\\nI rule.\\n\\nNIZAM \\n\\nPrecisely.\\n\\nNizam hesitates as he looks from one to the other…\\xa0then, on \\nsecond thought, simply settles into a smile.\\n\\nEXT. VILLAGE OF ZASHAD - DAY\\n\\nA sleepy little foothill town on the edge of the desert.  \\nToday it is overrun with SOLDIERS OF NASAF, going house-to-\\nhouse, searching for anyone remotely matching Dastan or \\nTamina’s description.\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY\\n\\nDastan and Tamina watch from a hill overlooking the town.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n(secretly relieved)\\n\\nSo much for finding a guide to \\ncross the desert.\\n\\nWe’ll have to get to take the \\nmountain route to Alamut instead.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYes…   \\n\\n(pause)\\n\\nImpossible!\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNot impossible -- difficult.  \\n\\nHe stands and looks down at a checkpoint where soldiers are \\nmonitoring the road.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT’D)\\nBut first we need to get past that \\ncheckpoint somehow… \\n\\nIntent on the problem, they don’t notice the ARCHER above, \\ndrawing a bead on them…\\xa0until Tamina turns with a gasp.\\n\\n\\x0c39.\\n\\nIt’s a YOUNG SHEPHERD, guarding his flock.\\n\\nDastan makes a friendly “excuse us” gesture, and hustles \\nTamina along.  Fiercely scowling, the SHEPHERD keeps the bow \\nand arrow trained on them as they pass.\\n\\nSeized by an afterthought, Dastan turns back…\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY\\n\\nNow naked, the Shepherd runs toward his hut shouting--\\n\\nSHEPHERD\\n\\nPapa!  Papa!\\n\\nWaving in his hand Dastan’s SILVER BRACELET.\\n\\nEXT. CHECKPOINT - DAY\\n\\nTamina, dressed as a shepherd, rides the mule as Dastan leads \\nit.  Dastan has shed his princely armor and looks like any \\ncommon traveler.  They join the throng of people and animals \\non the road.\\n\\nAs they approach the checkpoint, Tamina tenses up.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nDon’t worry.  I don’t look like a \\nprince of Nasaf any more than you \\nlook like a girl.\\n\\nTamina glowers but Dastan doesn’t notice.  They pass directly \\nin front of the soldiers, unnoticed.\\n\\nEXT.

Groups of \\ntravellers follow the road leading toward the wide open \\ndesert.\\n\\nCAMERA LIFTS UP over a rise to REVEAL:\\n\\nTracks in the sand lead to a pair of tiny figures who have \\nveered off, heading toward the mountains:  Dastan and Tamina.\\n\\n\\x0c40.\\n\\nEXT. FOOTHILLS - [LATER THAT] DAY\\n\\nDastan leads the mule.  Tamina is slumped forward in the \\nsaddle, asleep.  He glances at her and smiles to himself.\\n\\nAs soon as his back is turned, Tamina opens one eye.  Without \\nlifting her head, she very slowly raises her arm and reaches \\nout…\\xa0extending her fingers towards the DAGGER tucked into \\nDastan’s waistband… \\n\\nThe bounce in the mule’s gait brings her hand close… closer… \\ncloser…  as her fingers begins to close around the hilt--\\n\\nWHAM!  Dastan turns, quick as a cat, and grabs her wrist.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou want this dagger pretty badly, \\ndon’t you?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nLet go of me!\\n\\nDASTAN\\nNot until you tell me why.  \\nPrincess.\\n\\nShe stares.  \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nYou knew? \\n\\nHe nods, pleased with himself.  Her shock gives way to \\noutrage.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT’D)\\nYou knew and yet you made me go on \\nplaying the role of slave-girl?  \\nDoing your bidding-- \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(over her)\\n\\nYou are the one who has been lying.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n--cleaning your boots, carrying the \\nfirewood--\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(sharply)\\n\\nLet me see your hands.\\n\\n\\x0c41.\\n\\nConfused, Tamina shows him two empty hands.  Dastan deftly \\nties them together.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT’D)\\n\\nThere.  Now we can continue.\\n\\nOver her protests, he tosses her onto the mule’s back like a \\nsack of potatoes.\\n\\nEXT. ARMY CAMP - NIGHT\\n\\nA FULL REGIMENT of the Persian army-- hundreds of horsemen \\nwith a well-equipped supply train.  A SCOUT PATROL of half a \\ndozen men rides through -- the YOUNG SHEPHERD is in their \\ncustody.\\n\\nAT THE COMMAND TENT\\n\\nNIZAM and GARSIV meet the SCOUT CHIEF.  He forces the YOUNG \\nSHEPHERD forward and hands Nizam Dastan’s bracelet.\\n\\nSCOUT CHIEF\\nThis shepherd says he traded his \\nclothes and a mule for this \\nbracelet.  To a man and a woman.\\n\\n(recognizing the bracelet)\\nDastan… they slipped through the \\ncheckpoint in disguise. \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nShall I give orders to pursue every \\ncaravan that has set out for Alamut \\nacross the desert in the past two \\ndays?\\n\\nNizam shakes his head and glances in the direction of the \\nmountains.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nNo.  He has only one mule and no \\nguide… he won’t take the desert \\nroute.  He’ll try to cross the \\nmountains.\\n\\nGarsiv nods, acknowledging Nizam’s acumen. \\n\\n\\x0c42.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n(to his lieutenant)\\n\\nRouse the men.  We’re changing \\ncourse.\\n\\nORDERS RING OUT down the line…\\n\\nThe entire REGIMENT goes into motion.\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - [NEXT] DAY\\n\\nAgain Dastan leads the mule.  Tamina sways in the saddle, \\ntied in place by a turban cloth.  This time she really is \\nfaint with exhaustion and thirst.  \\n\\nThe mule comes to a halt, refusing to go further.\\n\\nDASTAN\\nCome on, you beast… move!\\n\\nThe mule acts like… a mule.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDon’t blame the animal.  He’s not \\nthe one who came up with this \\nsuicidal plan.\\n\\n(off Dastan’s look)\\n\\nHe’s tired and hungry.  As am I.  \\nUntie us before we both expire. \\n\\nDastan hesitates.  Tamina rolls her eyes.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT’D)\\nYou have nothing to fear from me.  \\nWhy would I attempt to take the \\ndagger again here, in this god-\\nforsaken wilderness?  Where would I \\ngo?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(relents)\\n\\nOut of pity for the mule.\\n\\nTAMINA\\nWhat about food and water?\\n\\nDASTAN \\nGod will provide. \\n\\nHe frees her.  Tamina rubs her wrists where they were bound.\\n\\n\\x0c43.\\n\\nDastan presses on.  Tamina and the mule follow.\\n\\nEXT. HILLSIDE - LATER\\n\\nDastan and Tamina climb a steep little stream until a NOMAD \\nCAMP comes into view below.  A dozen tents; mules and oxen.  \\nHungrily, Dastan sniffs the cooking aromas.\\n\\nI told you.  God will provide.\\n\\nHe watches from behind a rock, hiding.\\n\\nYou mean to steal these people’s \\nfood?\\n\\nThey’re bandits.  It all evens out.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nBandits?\\n\\nDASTAN\\nWait for me here.\\n\\nTHEIR POV:  A few fierce-looking NOMAD MEN emerge.  They all \\nwear weapons.  Tamina doesn’t like the looks of this.\\n\\nHe dashes down the hill before she can stop him.\\n\\nEXT. NOMAD CAMP - DAY\\n\\nDastan sneaks between the tents.  There are people around, \\nbut he manages to avoid being seen.  He ducks into a tent.\\n\\nINT. NOMAD TENT - DAY\\n\\nDastan checks a few bowls and a copper pot -- all empty.  \\nLooking around, he spots something hanging in a cloth; sniffs \\nit.  Inside is a giant lump of dried buttermilk curd.  He \\ntastes it:  not bad.   Famished he shoves a big handful into \\nhis mouth, takes the rest to go.\\n\\nStartled by a MOO, he turns to see a CALF watching him from a \\ndark corner of the tent.\\n\\nDastan and the calf share a moment:  “Okay, you caught me.”  \\nThen Dastan ducks out.\\n\\n\\x0c44.\\n\\nAnd back inside in an instant, as FEROCIOUSLY BARKING DOGS \\ndescend on the tent.  Dastan hastily ties the entrance flap \\nshut.  The tent SHAKES as the dogs hurl themselves at it.\\n\\nEXT. NOMAD TENT - DAY\\n\\nNOMAD BANDITS, alerted by the BARKING, come to investigate.\\n\\nDastan crawls out from under the other side of the tent.  \\nSpotting a CHICKEN strolling by, Dastan snatches it and \\ndashes for the hill.\\n\\nEXT. HILLSIDE - DAY\\n\\nTamina sees Dastan running up the hill toward her chased by \\nthe pack of dogs.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nRun!\\n\\nTamina hesitates… turns to run.  And nearly smacks into…\\n\\nFAROOD.\\n\\nA grizzled gypsy in his fifties.  Two rough-looking BANDITS \\nbehind him.  Utter incredulity on Farood’s face.\\n\\nDastan arrives, stops short on seeing their escape cut off.  \\nTurning to face the dogs, he reaches for his sword--\\n\\nOff!!\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nOn command, the dogs fall back, snarling.\\n\\nFarood looks Dastan up and down.  Dastan releases the chicken \\nhe’s holding.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n(re: Tamina)\\n\\nMy cousin…\\xa0he’s hungry.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nA man should take care of his \\nfamily.  I have a family too.  A \\nbig family.\\n\\nFarood indicates the camp below, where a crowd of curious \\nNOMAD WOMEN and CHILDREN has gathered to watch.  Among them, \\nis a GYPSY BOY (12), who glares bravely at Dastan.\\n\\n\\x0cTamina gapes in outrage.\\n\\n45.\\n\\nDid not the Prophet say:  “Give \\nfreely to those in need, for what \\nyou give, God will replace?”\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nA scholar!\\n\\nI’m only a poor student from \\nSamarkand.  My name is Ali.\\n\\n(before Tamina can speak)\\nAnd this is my cousin, Bukbuk.  \\nAlas, he’s mute.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nI am Farood.  These are my people; \\nwhat is mine is theirs.  Ali of \\nSamarkand, I will make you a \\nbargain; give me that fine sword \\nyou’re wearing and I’ll give you \\nthe chicken.\\n\\nA sword is worth more than a \\nchicken.\\n\\nA chicken is worth more to a hungry \\nthief than a sword to a dead one.\\n\\nThe worth of a sword depends on \\nwho’s wearing it.  To gain one \\nsword and one chicken at a cost of--\\n\\n(surveys the opposition)\\n\\n…eight men.  Ten if I’m lucky…  is \\nhardly taking care of one’s family.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFarood rubs his beard thoughtfully.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nYou have a high opinion of your own \\nswordsmanship, Ali of Samarkand.  \\nShall we put it to the test?\\n\\nA GIANT BANDIT steps forward.  Seven feet tall and grinning \\nevilly.  His friends place TWO SCIMITARS in his hands, which \\nhe brandishes in a blinding display of speed and skill.\\n\\n\\x0c46.\\n\\nDastan quickly recalculates the odds.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhy risk damaging such fine weapons \\nwhen we could settle the matter \\nwith a wager of skill…\\n\\n(dramatic pause)\\n\\n…a throw of the knife.\\n\\nThe bandits exchange dubious glances.  Dastan can sense it \\nwill take something impressive to get them to agree.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT’D)\\n\\nFrom twenty paces!\\n\\nFarood looks at him, bemused.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nTwenty-five and you have a bet.\\n\\nDastan takes his hand with a big grin:  no problem.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. NOMAD CAMP - MINUTES LATER\\n\\nDastan crouches behind a tent, hastily trying to fill the \\nDAGGER with SAND as he presses the jewel repeatedly.  It’s \\nnot working.\\n\\nFAROOD (O.S.)\\n\\nAli!  We’re waiting!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nJust a minute!\\n\\nTamina peers around the tent and sees what he’s up to.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(whispers)\\n\\nIt won’t work with ordinary sand!\\n\\nDastan looks up at her…  he gives up.  Taking a deep breath, \\nhe strides out into the circle of nomads where…\\n\\nA WOOD POST with an X has been set up.  A looong twenty-five \\npaces away a line in the sand marks Dastan’s throwing spot.\\n\\nTamina looks at Dastan in dismay -- what has he gotten into?  \\nDastan gives her a reassuring look.\\n\\n\\x0c47.\\n\\nHe flips the Dagger in his hand a few times, gauging its \\nweight.  The hollow handle makes for an awkward balance…\\n\\nDastan gets ready…  concentrating…\\xa0 he catches the unnerving \\nstare of the little Gypsy Boy -- and loses his concentration.  \\nFalse start.  Everyone exhales.\\n\\nDastan gives the kid a reproachful look:  “Don’t do that to \\nme!”  Gets ready again…\\n\\nAnd throws.\\n\\nWhop-whop-whop-whop…  PING!  The dagger hits the post \\nslightly off target-- and bounces off.    \\n\\nDastan turns to Farood hopefully.\\n\\nDASTAN \\nTwo out of three?\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\n(beat)\\n\\nCome.  We will speak man to man.\\n\\nFarood squires Dastan away.  Tamina, faced with being left \\nalone with a dozen nomad bandits, scurries after them.\\n\\nEXT. NOMAD CAMP - DAY\\n\\nFarood and Dastan pause at the edge of the camp.  Tamina \\nhovers ten feet away.    \\n\\nMay I ask… after I take your sword \\nand send you on your way without a \\nchicken, what is your plan?\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWithout food or weapons, I suppose \\nwe’ll die in a few days.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n(nods in agreement)\\n\\nYour destination?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nAlamut.  To find a cure for the \\ncurse that struck my cousin dumb.\\n\\n\\x0c48.\\n\\nDastan shoots a glance at Tamina, who has no choice but to \\nplay along.  She pretends to be oblivious.  Farood smiles at \\nher sympathetically, then turns back to Dastan.\\n\\nTamina glares furiously at Dastan as he nods in agreement.\\n\\nDastan shakes his head with empathy.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nIt’s not often in this wilderness \\nthat I meet a man as educated as \\nmyself.  Though as you can see, I \\nam virile as a bull -- alas, my \\nwives have given me no sons.  Only \\ndaughters.  Seven wives, eleven \\ndaughters.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nThis is my great sorrow.  All I \\nhave learned will die with me, like \\nunpicked grapes that wither on the \\nvine-- for what good is education \\nto a woman?  \\n\\nFAROOD (CONT’D)\\nA man of business needs a protogé-- \\na partner.  Where will I find such \\na man among this bunch of louts?\\n\\n(waves toward the bandits)\\n\\nOne might as easily teach a goat to \\nspeak.\\n\\nYour daughters are unmarried?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nThey are like eleven moons, each \\nmore beautiful than the next.  I \\nhave yet to find the man worthy of \\nthem.\\n\\nDastan looks back toward camp, thinking.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\nWe travel the same road.  Tonight \\nwe will cook the chicken you did \\nnot win.  My gift to you and your \\npoor cousin.  Did not the Prophet \\nsay it is a duty to give \\nhospitality to those in need?  \\n\\n\\x0cFarood strides off, leaving Dastan behind.  Tamina comes up \\nto him.\\n\\n49.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(mocking)\\n\\n‘What good is education to a \\nwomen?’\\n\\n(disgusted)\\n\\nYou can’t seriously mean for us to \\ntravel with that man?\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nHe’s uncivilized, rude, filthy, \\nbackward-- \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nShh!  You’re mute.\\n\\nLeft alone to simmer, Tamina notices a female nomad (HALEEMA) \\ngazing at her.  Haleema, built like a house, smiles \\ncoquettishly.  Tamina scowls and looks away.  Haleema’s smile \\nbroadens: she’s in love.\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY\\n\\nThe NOMAD CARAVAN wends its way along a mountain path, pack \\nanimals carrying the rolled up tents and mats.\\n\\nTamina watches Dastan, up ahead, showing off by doing \\nhandsprings between two mules.   The nomads, including the \\nlittle boy, laugh and applaud.  Dastan falls back to rejoin \\nTamina.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nHow nice.  You’ve found friends on \\nyour own level.\\n\\nAt least gypsies know how to have \\nfun.\\n\\nTAMINA\\nI’m talking about the mules.\\n\\nShe rides off.  \\n\\n\\x0c50.\\n\\nDastan hears muffled laughter and turns to see several gypsy \\nWOMEN riding up on camels.  Exotically beautiful, they giggle \\nand whisper behind their veils.\\n\\nON FAROOD\\n\\nDastan comes up beside him.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou chose your words well.  A moon \\nshines at night, but even daylight \\ncannot veil its beauty.\\n\\n(off Farood’s confusion)\\n\\nYour daughters.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\n(sees where Dastan looks)\\nOh, those aren’t my daughters!  I \\nwouldn’t let them dress like that.  \\nThose are my daughters.\\n\\nDastan follows his gesture to see…\\n\\nFAROOD’S ELEVEN DAUGHTERS\\n\\nRiding in a wagon.  Strong as men and twice as homely, they \\nglare at Dastan (Haleema among them).\\n\\nDastan stares.  Any one of them could break him in two.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nI’ve brought them up properly.  \\nHard workers-- and every one a \\nvirgin.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nAs my partner you could become a \\nrich man very quickly.  Perhaps you \\ncould afford to marry all my \\ndaughters.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\nDo you wish to know the secret of \\nmy success?  War.\\n\\n(confidentially)\\n\\nAlamut has fallen to a foreign \\narmy.  A great piece of luck-- for \\nus!  War is hard on soldiers and \\ncommon people.  But for men of \\nvision, war is an opportunity.  \\n\\n(MORE)\\n\\nDastan smiles queasily…\\n\\n\\x0c51.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\nSalt, cloth, things nobody thinks \\ntwice of in times of peace-- \\novernight the price goes up \\ntenfold.  This is why Farood will \\ntake his tribe to Alamut.\\n\\n(a wink re: his daughters)\\n\\nThink about my offer.\\n\\nBeaming he claps Dastan on the back and rides off.  \\n\\nDastan looks back at the daughters as they pass…\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nHaleema offers her a water flask.  Tamina shakes her head, \\nattempting to simultaneously convey masculinity, lack of \\ninterest and muteness.  Haleema insists.  Tamina gives in and \\ndrinks from the flask.\\n\\nFarood’s other ten daughters hoot with delight, startling \\nTamina into a coughing fit.  Haleema beams adoringly.  \\nApparently, sharing water is a significant nomad courtship.\\n\\nAs Tamina rides past, Dastan winks at her:\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI see you’ve found a friend too.\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - EVENING\\n\\nThe caravan is camped for the night.\\n\\nDastan uses the DAGGER to play mumbletypeg with the GYPSY \\nBOY.  He pauses, hearing a distant noise.  The noise grows \\ninto a THUNDER.  Everybody stands to look as…\\n\\nA CAVALRY REGIMENT charges past on the road above.   Dastan \\npulls Tamina aside.\\n\\nSoldiers of Nasaf.   \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nIt sounds like they sent the entire \\narmy after you.\\n\\nThe last of the horsemen disappear into the distance.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nThey won’t find us tonight at \\nleast.\\n\\n\\x0c52.\\n\\nThey settle down to prepare for sleep.  As Dastan removes his \\nboots, he notices Tamina staring at him.\\n\\nThe firelight bathes her skin in a warm glow.  Dastan stares \\nback, captivated by her beauty, a smile spreading over his \\nface until--\\n\\nHe realizes she’s not staring at him:  she’s staring at the \\nDAGGER in his belt!\\n\\nHis smile vanishes.  Dastan marches over and, without a word, \\nbinds her hands together with a length of rope.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n(protesting)\\n\\nWhat?  I didn’t do anything!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYour eyes give you away, Princess.\\n\\nDastan ties the other end of the rope to a nearby tree.  He \\nknots it firmly, then turns to see…\\n\\nThe Gypsy Boy staring at him.   \\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\n(stammers)\\n\\nMy cousin…  he is afflicted not \\nonly with muteness but also \\nsleepwalking.  If I don’t tie him \\nto a tree at night, he might wander \\noff and hurt himself. \\n\\nThe Gypsy Boy doesn’t move.  Dastan puts an arm around the \\nboy’s shoulder.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nIf my cousin should try to get free \\nwhile I’m asleep-- wake me.\\n\\nDastan glances once more at Tamina.  The murderous look on \\nher face makes him glad she’s tied up.  \\n\\nDastan makes a show of rolling the DAGGER inside his cloak, \\nwhich he then puts under his head as a pillow.  He waves good \\nnight to Tamina:  she’s not getting the dagger.  She glares \\nback at him and turns the other way.\\n\\nThe Gypsy Boy watches the proceedings with large, curious \\neyes. \\n\\n\\x0c53.\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\n\\nDastan promptly falls asleep.\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - [NEXT] MORNING\\n\\nDastan is awakened by sunlight in his eyes.  He’s overslept.\\n\\nHe sits up, feels his cloak with the reassuring LUMP of the \\nDAGGER inside. \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(turns toward Tamina)\\n\\nTime to get up--\\n\\nAnd freezes:  Tamina is gone.  He scrambles over and finds \\nthe frayed end of the rope…\\n\\nHis face fills with dread as he returns to his cloak and \\nhurriedly unwraps the bundle:\\n\\nTHE DAGGER IS GONE.  In its place is a stick about the same \\nsize.  Dastan’s face darkens with rage.\\n\\nEXT. CARAVAN - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nHaleema serves a bowl of warm goat’s milk to Tamina, who is \\nalready feasting on a hearty breakfast.  Haleema urges her to \\ndrink up as she goes off to get more food for her.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nStrides up and yanks Tamina rudely away.\\n\\nHa!  Not much of an escape when you \\nstop for breakfast.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nI didn’t escape.  Haleema came \\nalong and “freed” me this morning.\\n\\nTamina holds up the broken rope and pantomimes biting through \\nit. \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nHand it over.\\n\\nShe looks at him blankly.  Dastan sighs, then starts to pat \\nher down.  She slaps his hands away.\\n\\n\\x0c54.\\n\\nWhat do you think you’re doing?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nThe dagger.  Where is it?\\n\\nA look of horror on her face.  Dastan realizes:  Tamina \\ndoesn’t have it.  A beat. \\n\\nDASTAN AND TAMINA\\n\\n(at the same time)\\n\\nThe boy!\\n\\nDastan looks around the camp.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nHe left with Farood already.  They \\nwere heading for a market town. \\n\\nEXT. TRADING VILLAGE - DAY\\n\\nThe crossroads of the world.  Travelers run the gamut of the \\nSilk Road from Arab to Chinese.\\n\\nIN THE BAZAAR\\n\\nThe Gypsy Boy works the crowd.  His nimble fingers pluck a \\ncopper bracelet, unnoticed, from a fat merchant. \\n\\nAs the boy turns to go-- Dastan grabs him by the ear.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou’re quite the little pickpocket, \\naren’t you?   \\n\\nThe boy struggles in Dastan’s grip.  Tamina pats him down.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nWhere’s the dagger?\\n\\nGYPSY BOY\\n\\n(in Gypsy)\\n\\nI traded it!\\n\\nDASTAN \\nWhere is it now? \\n\\nThe boy holds up a fat coin purse.  Dastan snatches it.\\n\\nThe boy points across the square toward an INN.  They look up \\nand spy…\\n\\n\\x0c55.\\n\\nA GROUP OF NASAF SOLDIERS\\n\\nBullying their way through the bazaar, questioning the \\nmerchants, who plead ignorance.  \\n\\nTheir leader is GARSIV.  His keen eyes rove the crowd.\\n\\nDASTAN and TAMINA\\n\\nDuck behind a market stall to get out of sight.  The Gypsy \\nBoy takes the opportunity to scamper off.\\n\\nFAROOD (O.S.)\\nAli!  Bukbuk!  Why didn’t you say \\nyou wanted to come to the market?\\n\\nThey turn and find Farood, grinning broadly.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nCome.  Whatever you are here to \\nbuy, I will help you.  From Bukhara \\nto Baghdad, nobody drives a harder \\nbargain than Farood. \\n\\nDastan smiles weakly.\\n\\nThank you Farood but that won’t be \\nnecessary.  We have only one small \\nthing to buy… it’s nothing, really.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nThen we shall get it for nothing.\\n\\nFarood throws an arm around each of them and drags them out \\nfrom behind the stall.  \\n\\nDastan and Tamina, unable to resist, do their best to keep \\ntheir faces concealed.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\nThis is an excellent chance for you \\nto begin your apprenticeship, Ali.  \\nHave you thought about my proposal?\\n\\nTamina glances at Dastan, questioningly.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nAh yes…\\xa0your beautiful daughters.  \\nI can’t get them out of my head.   \\n\\n\\x0c56.\\n\\nINT. INN - LATER\\n\\nAn older female DANCER gyrates listlessly to the music played \\non drums, tambourines and flutes.  The tables are crowded \\nwith diverse travelers.\\n\\nFarood, Dastan and Tamina enter and make their way to…\\n\\nINT. BACK ROOM - SAME\\n\\nLENK, the wizened Mongolian innkeeper makes notes in his \\nledger.  Behind him is a middle-eastern pawn shop.  The \\nDAGGER sits prominently on a shelf. \\n\\nDastan disentangles himself from Farood and gestures for him \\nand Tamina to stay put.  \\n\\nDastan approaches the Innkeeper.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nSalaam Aleikum.  I’m told you are \\nnot only an innkeeper but a trader \\nof great renown.  \\n\\nLenk looks up slowly.  Takes him in.\\n\\nHe points.  Lenk picks up the dagger and examines it.\\n\\nLENK\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou have some worthless thing you \\nwant to sell?\\n\\nActually to buy.  A mere trinket.  \\nA small dagger of purely \\nsentimental value that I believe \\nyou… ah, there it is.  \\n\\nLENK\\n\\nA trinket?  This dagger has a gold \\nhilt encrusted with rubies and \\nsapphires.  The edge is sharp \\nenough to split hairs.  And the \\nworkmanship is so fine it looks as \\nif it were made by the gods.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(feigns disinterest)\\n\\nI’ve seen better…  how much do you \\nwant for it?\\n\\n\\x0c57.\\n\\nOne hundred dinars.\\n\\nLENK\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nDone.\\n\\nQuick as a flash, Dastan slaps the coin purse on the table.\\n\\nLenk picks up the purse with surprise.\\n\\nFarood jumps forward and grabs it back.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nNo, no, no!  That’s no way to \\nbargain!\\n\\n(to Lenk)\\n\\nTwenty dinars.\\n\\nLENK\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nThe price has already been agreed.\\n\\nIt’s true, the price has been \\nagreed.\\n\\nFAROOD\\nNobody pays the first price \\noffered.\\n\\n(to Lenk)\\n\\nHe is a beginner.  Fifty dinars.\\n\\nOne hundred dinars.\\n\\nLENK\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nYou are thief, not an innkeeper!  \\nCome, we’re leaving.\\n\\nFarood grabs Dastan and hustles him out.\\n\\nOUTSIDE THE BACK ROOM\\n\\nDastan stops Farood.\\n\\nFarood, you don’t understand.  I \\nwant that dagger.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nOh, he’ll come running after us and \\ntake the fifty dinars, wait and \\nsee.\\n\\n\\x0c58.\\n\\nDastan whisks the purse from Farood and heads back.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nNo, he must come to us!\\n\\n(shakes his head)\\n\\nIt’s going to take some time to \\nteach him.\\n\\nINT. BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nDastan hurries to the desk.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI accept.  One hundred dinars.\\n\\nHe puts the money in front of Lenk who, offended, doesn’t \\nlook up from his writing.\\n\\nNo deal.\\n\\nLENK\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nLENK\\n\\nAll right then, name your price.\\n\\nThere is no price!  Am I a beggar \\nto take insults from a gypsy?\\n\\nDastan is at a loss.  Now he’s completely screwed.\\n\\nTAMINA (O.S.)\\n\\nSuppose I ask you.\\n\\nLenk’s pen freezes at the sound of the sweet, feminine voice.  \\nHe looks up to see where it came from…\\n\\nTamina steps forward and removes her turban.  Shakes loose \\nher long dark hair.  A beat.  Lenk grins.\\n\\nLENK\\n\\nFor you, the price is one hundred \\ndinars…\\xa0and one dance for my \\nguests.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(instantly)\\n\\nDone.\\n\\nTamina looks at him in shock and betrayal.\\n\\n\\x0c59.\\n\\nINT. INN, BACK STAGE - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan hovers outside a curtained doorway.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(guiltily)\\n\\nIt must feel good to get out of \\nthose rags.\\n\\nTAMINA (V.O.)\\n\\n(coldly, from within)\\n\\nGo away.\\n\\nINT. INN - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan pulls up an ottoman behind Farood’s.  Farood glances \\nat the dagger in Dastan’s belt.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nI don’t mean to be critical, Ali, \\nbut you got the worst of that \\nbargain.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(his eyes on the stage)\\n\\nMaybe not the absolute worst.\\n\\nJust then, the musicians strike up a rousing dance rhythm.  \\nThe customers lift their heads expectantly.\\n\\nThe musicians continue… and continue.  Still the stage \\nremains empty.  The BAND LEADER beckons furiously toward \\nbackstage; gives the crowd a phony smile.\\n\\nAt that moment, the front door opens.  Dastan turns to see:\\n\\nGARSIV and SIX SOLDIERS enter with a blast of cold air from \\noutside.  The soldiers take several tables, displacing the \\nlocals.\\n\\nDastan turns pale. He pushes his chair back into the shadows \\nbehind a pillar, so that he is concealed from Garsiv’s view.\\n\\nFarood notes Dastan’s reaction, realizing something is up.\\n\\nON STAGE\\n\\n\\x0c60.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nTamina edges into view.  She wears a veil and holds a scarf \\nin each hand, as is traditional in Mongolian yak-herding \\nregions.  She looks as if she wants to sink into the floor.  \\nSomeone backstage SHOVES her on -- she reacts angrily.\\n\\nwinces.  The crowd is starting to mutter.  He glances \\nnervously to see if Garsiv has noticed.\\n\\nFar from suspicious, Garsiv seems perversely amused by the \\nspectacle onstage.  He turns to his LIEUTENANT.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nPretty girl.  A pity she can’t \\ndance.\\n\\nHiding behind the pillar frantically gestures to Tamina to \\n“dance.”  She glares back at him.  He demonstrates, showing \\nher how she needs to move her hips…\\xa0then sees Farood looking \\nat him.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n(”grooving”)\\n\\nThe music is good, isn’t it?\\n\\nVentures a timid dance step.  The crowd BOOS.  Someone throws \\na chicken bone at the stage.\\n\\nDastan makes more emphatic “dance” gestures for Tamina behind \\nFarood’s back, indicating the soldiers with his eyes.\\n\\nTamina looks.  Registers Garsiv’s presence.\\n\\nTamina’s expression changes.  Glaring defiantly at Dastan, \\nshe shakes her booty in the manner he advised.  The crowd \\nHOOTS and applauds.  The band leader, relieved, kicks the \\nmusic up a notch.\\n\\nTamina dances, with plenty of hip gyrations and scarf-\\ntwirling.  Her eyes glint with cunning.\\n\\nGarsiv is riveted.\\n\\nDastan watches nervously as…\\xa0\\n\\n\\x0c61.\\n\\nTamina dances off the stage, cutting a swath through the \\nroom, straight toward Dastan.  All the time she keeps one eye \\non the soldiers.  Alarmed, Dastan ducks under the table, \\nbaffling Farood.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nI think I dropped some…\\n\\nTamina pulls Dastan to his feet.  His back is to Garsiv and \\nthe soldiers so they can’t see his face.  \\n\\nTamina dances seductively around him.  Her hands caress his \\nbody without actually touching.  Her breath sears his cheek \\nthrough the veil.\\n\\nTHE NOMADS AND YAK HERDERS\\n\\nStare open-mouthed.  They’ve never seen anything like this.  \\nThe gypsy boy, his sight blocked by grown-ups, strains for a \\nbetter view.\\n\\nGARSIV speaks to his lieutenant without taking his eyes off \\nTamina:\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nWhatever that girl costs -- pay it.\\n\\nTAMINA and DASTAN\\n\\nShe’s outdoing herself, putting on an erotic floor show that \\nhas riveted the whole room. \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(hisses)\\n\\nThat’s enough!\\n\\nTamina keeps it up, smiling wickedly; she draws a gossamer \\nscarf across Dastan’s face.  He’s sweating bullets.\\n\\nBefore he’s quite realized what’s happening, she’s drawn the \\nDAGGER from his belt-- wrapping it in several turns of her \\nscarf-- and is dancing away.\\n\\nOutraged, Dastan starts to go after her-- then stops.  If he \\npursues her, Garsiv will surely see him.  He steps back into \\nthe shadow of the pillar, out of sight. \\n\\nTamina dances back to the stage, having gotten what she \\nwanted.  But as she passes the table of soldiers…\\n\\nHer eyes briefly meet Garsiv’s through the veil.  Is that \\nlust or recognition in his stare?    \\n\\n\\x0c62.\\n\\nUnnerved, Tamina hurries onto the stage.  With a final \\nflourish of scarves, she disappears through the curtain.\\n\\nThe room ERUPTS.  They’ll be talking about this for months.\\n\\nGlowering, jumps to his feet.  He makes a beeline for the \\nstage but his way is blocked by the crowd of Tamina’s \\nadmirers.  Lenk patiently handles the crush of MERCHANTS and \\nTRADERS thrusting coin purses at him…\\n\\nDastan glances back across the room to the table where Garsiv \\nwas sitting.  It’s empty.\\n\\nEXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT\\n\\nTamina hurries down alleys, glancing over her shoulder.  \\nMongolian MEN, loitering in groups in the darkness, notice.\\n\\nClimbs onto a rooftop.  Up a series of ladders, drainpipes \\nand awnings until he has a vantage point of the surrounding \\nstreets and alleys.\\n\\nNimble as a cat, he runs and jumps from one rooftop to the \\nnext, scanning all the while for a sign of…\\n\\nRounds a corner and spots an unattended pony.  She goes over \\nto untie the animal.  She hears a footstep and turns…\\n\\nsteps into the light.  His soldiers fan out in a semi-circle, \\ncutting off her escape. \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nGARSIV \\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nA magnificent dancer and a horse \\nthief.  You have so many talents.\\n\\nTamina hides the dagger inside her robe.\\n\\nTAMINA\\nI will pay for the horse.\\n\\nGARSIV \\n\\nYes, you will.  And for helping the \\nassassin Dastan escape, Slave-Girl. \\n\\n\\x0c63.\\n\\nTamina puts on a brave face but she knows the game is up: \\nGarsiv has recognized her.  The soldiers seize her roughly.  \\n\\nANGLE ON DASTAN\\n\\nWatching from a rooftop.  He follows, and watches them take \\nher away to…\\n\\nEXT. GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nSOLDIERS sweep through the gate on horseback.  \\n\\nGarsiv dismounts and approaches one of the guards.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nSend for Nizam.  He’ll want to be \\nwoken for this.\\n\\nEXT. CARAVAN - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan paces back and forth, gripping his sword and muttering \\nto himself.  He draws a line in the dirt and starts making \\nhash marks on either side to weigh pros and cons…\\n\\nDASTAN\\n(on the con side)\\n\\n…the place is well-guarded and \\nyou’d probably get yourself killed…\\n\\n(in the pro column)\\n…she has that magic dagger…\\n\\n(con)\\n\\n(pro)\\n\\n…only because she stole it from you \\nat the Inn…\\n\\n…if you don’t rescue her, Garsiv \\nwill do with her as he pleases…\\n\\nThat really burns him up.  \\n\\nFarood comes up behind him.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nIf you are finished drawing in the \\ndirt, Ali of Samarkand, we are \\npreparing to go.  \\n\\n(a beat)\\n\\nWhere is your cousin?\\n\\nDastan turns. \\n\\n\\x0c64.\\n\\nThat is a long story.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nIs it a good story?\\n\\nFarood takes a seat on a rock and makes himself comfortable.  \\nDastan sighs; he’s going to have to tell him something.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nI have a confession to make Farood;  \\nBukbuk is not my cousin.  Bukbuk is \\nmy…\\xa0fiancée.  You see--\\n\\nFarood holds up a hand.\\n\\nFarood grins broadly and slaps Dastan on the shoulder. Dastan \\nnods and starts lying quickly: \\n\\nI make no judgements.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nBukbuk was the dancing girl.   I \\nmean, the dancing girl was Bukbuk.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\n(confused)\\n\\nWhat…?  Oh… you mean…?  Ahhh!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nOur parents forbid the marriage so \\nwe fled.  Her father had us \\ndeclared outlaws and sent the \\nsoldiers after us.  We escaped by \\ndisguising ourselves…  Now after \\nall we’ve been through, she has \\nbeen captured. \\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nThat is a good story, Ali.  Tragic \\nbut with a romantic flavor. \\n\\nDASTAN\\nWill you help me rescue her?\\n\\nDastan hangs his head.\\n\\nFarood stands and dusts off his hands.\\n\\n\\x0c65.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nFarood may share a chicken with a \\nhungry thief, but he does not risk \\nhis neck for an amusing story. \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhat about a trade?\\xa0 \\n\\nFarood turns and sees that Dastan is holding out something \\nshiny: a gold ring.  Farood hesitates, then takes the ring \\nand inspects it.  \\n\\nFAROOD \\n\\nYou’re either a very rich student \\nAli, or a very good thief.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. GRAND HOUSE, UPSTAIRS CHAMBER - NIGHT\\n\\nTamina is fighting like a wild animal, restrained by TWO \\nLARGE SOLDIERS struggling to hold her by the arms.\\n\\nGarsiv is in front of her. \\n\\nTell us where Dastan is!\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nFool!  I fled alone.  Isn’t that \\nevidence enough that his \\nwhereabouts are not my concern?\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nYou will talk!\\n\\nNIZAM (O.S.)\\n\\n(a stern voice)\\n\\nLet her go!\\n\\nShe writhes in their grasp and kicks her legs.  Then…\\n\\nThe soldiers instantly obey.  Nizam steps forward, having \\nentered the room unseen.  Garsiv and the others step back. \\n\\nNizam walks up to Tamina. \\n\\nNIZAM (CONT’D)\\n\\nAre you hurt, child?\\n\\n\\x0c66.\\n\\nTamina catches her breath and shakes her head.  He looks at \\nher carefully.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\n\\nWhat a beautiful face… I see \\nnobility in your features and in \\nyour eyes… \\n\\nHe runs a finger over her cheekbone.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT’D)\\nAnd your accent betrays a Palace \\neducation. The King of Alamut had a \\ndaughter…  \\n\\nTamina tries not to react as Nizam runs his finger down her \\nthroat to the clasp of her robe… \\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\nUnderneath this common disguise I \\nsuspect we’d find a royal treasure…\\n\\nWith sudden violence, he rips open her outer robe revealing \\nthe DAGGER tucked into her inner garment. \\n\\nA beat.  Tamina makes a move to reach for it-- Garsiv and \\nboth soldiers have their swords at her throat in no time.\\n\\nShe freezes as Nizam gently lifts the DAGGER from its place.  \\nHe gazes at it like a long lost child.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\nTwenty-five years…  that’s how long \\nI’ve searched for this.\\n\\nThat dagger is sacred.  By all that \\nis Holy I command you--\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nCommand?  Your days of commanding \\nare over, Princess.\\n\\nGarsiv is completely puzzled.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nMy Lord, I don’t understand… what \\nis that dagger?\\n\\n\\x0c67.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nIt is the key to a treasure of \\nunimaginable value, Garsiv.  A \\ntreasure we will find in Alamut.\\n\\nHe bows slightly to Tamina and heads for the door.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\n\\nAt first light, we leave for \\nAlamut.  We can take the desert \\nroute now.  It will be faster.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nBut…\\xa0 what about Prince Dastan?\\n\\nNIZAM\\nHe no longer matters.   \\n\\n(to Tamina)\\n\\nYou on the other hand, will come \\nwith us.  You are going to guide me \\nto the Hourglass.\\n\\nShe shoots him a look of pure hatred.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nNever.\\n\\nNizam only smiles, then exits.  Garsiv steps forward and \\nwhispers in her ear.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nDastan may no longer matter to \\nNizam, but he matters to me. \\n\\nHe nods to the soldiers who pin her arms and bind her wrists \\ntogether.  Garsiv, still breathing down her neck, knots a \\nLENGTH of ROPE to her bound wrists.  \\n\\nGARSIV (CONT’D)\\n\\nFirst light is still hours away. \\n\\nHe throws the other end of the rope over a rafter and pulls \\nit tight until her arms are stretched up over her head.\\n\\nGARSIV (CONT'D)\\nYou’ll tell me where he is before \\ndawn.  I promise you.\\n\\nHe gives the rope an extra tug and ties it to a cleat on the \\nwall.  He leaves her alone, standing painfully on her toes.\\n\\n\\x0c68.\\n\\nEXT. GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nA pair of SOLDIERS guard the gate surrounding the compound.\\n\\nFarood approaches, a bottle in hand, weaving slightly.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nSalaam aliekum.\\n\\nAs he bows to the soldiers a pair of dice falls out of his \\nsleeve and rolls up to their feet…  their eyes meet.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nA FEW MINUTES LATER\\n\\nAs Farood plays dice and drinks with the guards…\\n\\nDastan scales the wall in the background.  He scampers over \\nand jumps to… \\n\\nA LARGE WALNUT TREE\\n\\nDastan climbs up and out a limb toward the house. \\n\\nINT. GRAND HOUSE, UPSTAIRS CHAMBER - SAME\\n\\nTamina is tied up where Garsiv left her.  She rubs and twists \\nher wrists together in a desperate effort to fray the rope.  \\nIt’s no use.  \\n\\nSuddenly a movement outside the window catches her eye.  She \\nturns and sees…\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nperched on a tree limb as far out as he can go.  \\n\\nTamina’s eyes light up with astonishment and hope.  She can’t \\nbelieve he’s here. \\n\\nHe puts his finger to his lips-- points down.\\n\\nREVEAL MORE SOLDIERS \\n\\nKeeping watch around the house.  Dastan assesses the \\nsituation:  fifteen feet to the window-- too far to jump.  \\n\\nON TAMINA - she hears footsteps outside the door.\\n\\n\\x0c69.\\n\\nShe makes an impatient face at Dastan:  “Get me out of here!”\\n\\nHe holds up a finger:  “Give me a second, I’m thinking!”\\n\\nDastan stares through the open window at her bound wrists.  \\nGets an idea.  He takes out a knife and starts flipping it in \\nhis hand.  Looks at Tamina:\\n\\nDASTAN\\n(mouths silently)\\n\\nDON’T MOVE.\\n\\nTamina sees what he’s planning.   \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(mouths back)\\n\\nNO!\\n\\nHe nods reassuringly:  “I can do this.”\\n\\nShe shakes her head emphatically:  “No you can’t.”\\n\\nIgnoring her, Dastan braces himself and takes aim.  She \\nshakes her head furiously:  NO!\\n\\nDastan cocks the knife:  one, two, three…\\n\\nJust as he releases, a HISSING sound distracts Dastan:  A \\nLARGE SNAKE is coiling itself around the branch by his feet!\\n\\nDastan jerks.\\n\\n     The knife flies through the window.  \\n\\n          Tamina closes her eyes as the knife sails past and…\\n\\nTHWACK!  It slices through the rope where it’s tied to the \\nwall, causing it to go slack.  \\n\\nTamina opens her eyes in amazement and realizes her arms are \\nno longer held up.  She yanks the rope from the rafter and \\nruns to the window.  She sees Dastan doing a curious dance on \\nthe tree branch…\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\n(whispers loudly)\\n\\nStop fooling around and catch this \\nrope!\\n\\nDastan looks up as Tamina throws the rope.  The snake \\nstrikes:  Dastan jumps.  Catches the rope in mid-air…\\n\\n\\x0c70.\\n\\nTamina is yanked OUT the window by her bound wrists.  They \\nplummet toward the ground until…\\xa0 the rope catches on a lower \\nbranch:  they bounce to a halt, ten feet above the ground.\\n\\nThey swing back and forth for a moment. \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\n(hissed whisper)\\n\\nYou know, for a minute I thought \\nyou were actually going to try to \\ncut my hands free with that knife \\nthrow…\\n\\nDastan laughs nervously.  Her eyes narrow: that’s exactly \\nwhat he was trying to do. \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nYou--\\n\\nCRACK!  The branch breaks sending them crashing to the \\nground. \\n\\nTWO SOLDIERS come running…\\n\\nSOLDIERS\\n\\nWho goes there?\\n\\nDastan and Tamina pull the rope taught into a tripline and \\nsweep the onrushing guards off their feet even as she \\ncontinues to vent her fury.\\n\\nDastan RAPS the soldiers’ heads together before they can get \\nup.\\n\\nTamina takes off running toward the house… then runs out of \\nrope and comes crashing to the ground. \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nI can’t believe you!  The only \\nreason you didn’t kill me is that \\nyou’re such a bad shot you didn’t \\ncome close!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nIs that your way of saying “thank \\nyou for rescuing me?”\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nWrong way.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThe dagger is this way.\\n\\n\\x0c71.\\n\\nTwo more GUARDS emerge from the house and start toward them.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nEscape is this way.\\n\\nDastan pulls her back to him and cuts her free.  He takes her \\nby the hand and sets off running away from the house… \\n\\nINT. GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nGarsiv arrives at the door to the chamber where he left \\nTamina, an unpleasant grin on his face.

GRAND HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nFarood waits nervously with two camels.  There’s a rustling \\nin the tree branches above and…\\n\\nDastan drops down beside him.  He reaches up to help Tamina… \\nwho ignores him and jumps down on her own.\\n\\nFarood looks her over.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nI like you better as a woman, \\nBukbuk.  One thing I don’t \\nunderstand…  are you still a mute?\\n\\nBefore she can respond they HEAR SHOUTS of ALARM raised \\nwithin.  Farood hands them both full length BURKHAS.

MOUNTAINS - DAWN\\n\\nThe nomad caravan is waking up.\\n\\nTAMINA and DASTAN take off their disguises.  \\n\\nHe gives her the shepherd outfit and dutifully faces away \\nfrom her while she changes into it.\\n\\n\\x0c72.\\n\\nPerhaps I have been wrong about \\nyou.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nHow so?\\n\\nYou risked your life to come back \\nfor me\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(gruff)\\n\\nI only came to get you because you \\nhad the dagger.

She smiles \\nand walks away.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\n(after her)\\nYou’re welcome.\\n\\nEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nTamina stands at an overlook.  The regiment of Nasaf soldiers \\nrides out into the valley below, departing for Alamut across \\nthe desert route. \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThey were never after you.

He sent a great sand \\nstorm to destroy every living thing \\nand wipe clean the face of the \\nearth.’\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n‘But the Great Mother said to the \\nsun god:  “Who are you to destroy \\nmy creation?”  And she blew the \\nsands into an Hourglass so strong \\nno sword nor spear could break it.  \\nAnd thus she spoke:  “These are the \\nSands of Time.  As you decreed, all \\nthat lives shall die-- but not at \\nonce.  Rather day by day, hour by \\nhour, as the sand flows through the \\nhourglass, so shall life slip away \\nfrom all my children, until it is \\nempty.”’\\n\\nHer words die into reverential silence-- which Dastan breaks.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFirst of all, there is only one \\nGod.  Second, the way I heard it, \\nit was a flood, not a sand storm.\\n\\nShe gives him a withering look. \\n\\nTAMINA\\nFor ten thousand years the \\nHourglass holding the Sands of Time \\nhas rested here in Alamut, below \\nthe temple.  The dagger is the key, \\nthe only blade that can penetrate \\nthe glass.  Do you understand?\\n\\n\\x0cDastan absorbs this…  a thought is forming in his head.\\n\\n80.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nHow does it work?  Is there a limit \\nto how far back you can rewind \\ntime?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nIt is forbidden to use more than a \\nminute of sand.   \\n\\nBut could it be done?  Could Nizam \\ngo back years for example?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(fearful)\\n\\nWhy do you ask?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhen Nizam and my father were mere \\nboys, they used to go hunting \\ntogether, just the two of them. My \\nfather often told a story about the \\ntime he fell before a wild boar-- \\nand how Nizam saved his life.  If \\nNizam could go back in time and not \\nsave my father… \\n\\nTAMINA\\n…then he would become king.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nExactly.  I’ve been trying to \\nfigure out why Nizam would risk \\neverything for the dagger.  After \\nall, he already has wealth and \\npower.  But a chance to start life \\nover again and live as King… if \\nthat were possible…\\n\\nTamina looks at him gravely.\\n\\nTAMINA \\n\\nIt is.  With the dagger and the \\nHourglass, Nizam will control time \\nitself.\\n\\nHOLD ON DASTAN as the consequences sink in…\\n\\n\\x0c81.\\n\\nEXT. ALAMUT - LATE AFTERNOON\\n\\nA muezzin gives the “call to prayer” from a towering minaret \\nrising above the citadel. \\n\\nA TIME LAPSE SHOT accelerates the sun’s passage across the \\nsky, REVEALING that the SPIRE casts a shadow across a GIANT \\nSUN DIAL hewn into the ancient courtyard.\\n\\nA LOCAL SERVING GIRL scurries down an alleyway to find…\\n\\nTAMINA and DASTAN, \\n\\nIn the shadows.  The SERVING GIRL whispers to Tamina, in \\nForeign.  After delivering her message, she bows deeply and \\nkisses Tamina’s hand before departing.\\n\\nTamina leads Dastan through a twisting maze of narrow stone \\npassageways and back alleys.\\n\\nDASTAN\\nOkay, so you really are the \\nPrincess.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nI know where the dagger is.  \\n\\nHow?     \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA \\n\\nThe women of Alamut scrub the \\nfloors and cook the food for your \\narmy.  They hear everything.  And \\nthey are fiercely loyal to me.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\nNizam has occupied the Red Palace. \\nWhen he arrived, Nizam placed \\nsomething inside the treasure \\nvault.  It is secured with a single \\ndoor of solid stone and they say \\nNizam wears the key around his neck \\nat all times.  As an added \\nprecaution, he has ordered two \\ndozen soldiers to guard the \\nentrance, day and night.  \\n\\nThey press into a doorway while a troop of Nasaf soldiers \\nmarches by.   \\n\\n\\x0c82.\\n\\nThey emerge into the sunlight and look up at:\\n\\nTHE RED PALACE, \\n\\nan imposing stone fortress of towers and battlements.  The \\nstone has a pinkish cast.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nIt was built in ancient times by \\nmaster stone-cutters so skilled \\nthat the bricks need no mortar to \\nhold them together.  The walls are \\nthree-feet thick and the gates are \\nfortified.\\n\\nDastan stares in silence.  She glances at him and does a \\ndouble-take.  From his vacant stare, she’s worried that he’s \\noverwhelmed by the challenge. \\n\\nIn fact, he’s thinking… an idea forming in his mind. \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNo mortar…\\n\\n(turns to her)\\n\\nCan your subjects get us inside of \\nthere, Princess?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(hesitates)\\n\\nI can think of one way it might be \\npossible… but you won’t like it.\\n\\nOFF HIS REACTION \\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nINT. RED PALACE, HALLWAY - NIGHT\\n\\nAn ALAMUT MATRON leads a group of half a dozen VEILED GIRLS \\ndown the hallway.  One of them is noticeably taller and \\nbroader than the others.  REVEAL…\\n\\nDASTAN disguised as a girl (and looking none-too-pleased \\nabout it).

Tomorrow \\nI want the number of slaves working \\ndoubled.\\n\\nWe are already using all the slaves \\nwe have, my Lord.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nThen they will work double shifts.\\n\\nNIZAM looks up and sees…\\n\\nTHE MATRON and the VEILED “GIRLS,”\\n\\nComing down the hallway from the opposite direction.  He \\nholds up his hand.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT’D)\\n\\nWhat is this?\\n\\nALAMUT MATRON\\n\\n(bowing)\\n\\nNew virgins for the Harem, my Lord. \\n\\nNizam walks suspiciously down the line, inspecting the girls \\none by one.  Their faces are completely hidden except for the \\neyes…\\n\\nAs Nizam approaches, Dastan shrinks behind his veil and looks \\ndown.    \\n\\nDASTAN’S POV - Nizam’s feet stop right in front of him.  \\n\\nNIZAM (O.S.)\\nThis one has an uncommonly pretty \\nfigure.  Long limbs, narrow waist… \\n\\nINSERT:  Dastan’s eyes go wide.  His fingers curl around the \\nhilt of his sword beneath his disguise…  \\n\\n\\x0c84.\\n\\nNIZAM (O.S.) (CONT’D)\\n\\nShe shall serve us tonight.\\n\\nDastan looks up and sees that…\\n\\nNizam is talking about Tamina, who is right beside him.  He \\nand Garsiv sweep off down the hall.\\n\\nTamina and Dastan exchange a panicked glance.  Tamina shoves \\na FOLDED DIAGRAM into his hand as she’s pulled away.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(whispers)\\n\\nDon’t wait for me.  Find the \\ndagger.\\n\\nINT. HAREM ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSatin cushions, delicacies from the orient, beautiful women \\nveiled in gossamer and silk. \\n\\nDastan enters with the Alamut Matron.  He stops and stares \\nfor a moment, grinning.  The girls don’t even notice him--\\nhe’s completely forgotten that he’s disguised as a woman.\\n\\nThe Alamut Matron tugs at his sleeve.\\n\\nALAMUT MATRON\\n\\nThis way!  Hurry!\\n\\nDastan snaps out of it.  He quickly strips off his disguise \\nin preparation for the next step of his mission.  Now he gets \\nplenty of looks from the girls!\\n\\nNo time to stay and enjoy the attention.  He follows the \\nMatron to a side door.   \\n\\nINT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nDastan hurries down the corridor alone, consulting the \\nDIAGRAM Tamina has given him.\\n\\nHe stops at an ORNATE FOUNTAIN depicted on the drawing.  He \\norients himself, then starts carefully counting out paces.\\n\\nHe arrives at the “spot” marked on the diagram.  He kneels by \\nthe wall, unslinging a sack from around his shoulders.  He \\nselects a particular one of the STONE BLOCKS in the wall \\n(each about 18 inches square).  \\n\\n\\x0c85.\\n\\nHe takes out a THREADED METAL BOLT and a MALLET and prepares \\nto hammer the bolt into the center of the BLOCK.   \\n\\nCLANG!  He winces at the sound of his hammer striking the \\nBOLT.  Nothing he can do about it…  CLANG!  CLANG!  \\n\\nINT. PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT\\n\\nNizam and Garsiv are seated at a long low table laid with \\nfood.  Tamina waits on them, setting down dishes, pouring \\nwine, etc.  She is careful never to let them get a good look \\nat her.\\n\\nWE HEAR the muffled sound of Dastan hammering the bolt off \\nscreen somewhere…  a distant metallic ring.\\n\\nGARSIV\\nDid you hear that, my Lord?\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nTamina, arranging serving spoons, begins loudly placing them \\non the table -- PLING!  PLING! PLING! -- in time with \\nDastan’s hammer. \\n\\nThey glance in her direction, distracted.  She bows and \\nmumbles an apology IN FOREIGN. \\n\\nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan puts down the mallet and screws the bolt the rest of \\nthe way into the stone.\\n\\nMaking sure the bolt is secure, Dastan attaches a length of \\nrope to its head.  He circles the rope around a MASSIVE \\nPILLAR, five feet in diameter, on the other side of the \\ncorridor, creating a loop.  \\n\\nThen Dastan turns this into a winch by threading an iron bar \\nthrough the rope and turning it around and around.  (Think \\nwinding the rubber band of a toy airplane.)\\n\\nAs the tension on the rope becomes greater, Dastan struggles \\nharder and harder to turn the bar.  Finally there is a \\nscraping sound and…\\n\\nTHE STONE BLOCK BEGINS TO SLIDE OUT!\\n\\n\\x0c86.\\n\\nINT. PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT\\n\\nTamina walks into the room with a steaming tray of rice.\\n\\nNizam pushes his plate away and prepares to stand.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nI want to get back to the dig to \\nsee what progress has been made.\\n\\nGarsiv sets down his fork mid-bite.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nOf course.  I will come with you.\\n\\nLet us stop by the vault first to \\nmake sure everything is secure.\\n\\nTamina’s face registers alarm.  Nizam is already on his feet.  \\nGarsiv is taking a last swig of wine.  She has to act fast…\\n\\nTamina steps forward, collides with Nizam and…\\xa0spills hot \\nrice all over Garsiv’s lap!\\n\\nGarsiv leaps to his feet with a roar, upsetting the table.  \\nWine and food go all over his clothes.\\n\\nGARSIV\\nYou clumsy fool!\\n\\nTamina spits out a stream of apologies IN FOREIGN.  She \\nstarts wiping Garsiv with a CLOTH.  Other Alamut SERVING \\nGIRLS rush in to help.\\n\\nIt’s chaos.  Tamina whispers an instruction to one of the \\ngirls and slips out of the room. \\n\\nINT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan has repeated the process to pull more stone blocks \\nfree, creating a tunnel-like opening through the wall, barely \\nwide enough to crawl through.\\n\\nDastan glances over his shoulder:  no sign of Tamina.  He \\nhesitates, then squeezes into the opening…\\n\\n\\x0c87.\\n\\nINT.

TREASURE VAULT\\n\\nDastan HEARS the sound of the key in the lock.\\n\\nTamina HEARS the heavy footsteps of soldiers approaching down \\nthe corridor they crawled in from.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThey’re coming.   \\n\\nDastan slings a coil of rope over his shoulder.  He takes a \\ndeep breath and backs up as far as he can in the tiny room…\\n\\nHe gets a three-step start and begins running up the walls!  \\n\\nHe bounces off each wall as he spirals upwards, Jet-Li style. \\nIt’s like he’s climbing a vertical staircase.  \\n\\nFifteen feet, twenty, twenty-five, he’s practically \\nhorizontal by the time he--\\n\\nGrabs the window sill.  \\n\\nDastan hoists himself up into the slit of an opening and \\ndrops the rope back down for Tamina. \\n\\nINT. INNER CHAMBER/TREASURE VAULT\\n\\nNizam turns the lock and steps aside.  The two GIANTS slide \\nthe door open.  Nizam and Garsiv charge inside and find…\\n\\nThe GLASS CASE IS EMPTY.\\n\\nLOW ANGLE SHOT - far above their heads, as they stare down at \\nthe empty case, Dastan is hauling Tamina up, unnoticed. \\n\\nNizam looks around the room and spots the hole in the wall.  \\nFinally he looks upward -- just a half-second after Tamina \\nhas disappeared.\\n\\n\\x0c89.\\n\\nHe turns to Garsiv.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n(quietly furious)\\n\\nSeal the Palace.  \\n\\nEXT. PALACE ROOFTOP - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan and Tamina race across the rooftop.  As the soldiers \\nbelow buzz like a hive of angry bees, they make their escape \\ndescending by rope down a dark side of the building.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. ALAMUT - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan and Tamina finally stop running and take shelter in a \\ndark archway to catch their breath.  Dastan peeks out to \\ncheck: no sign of pursuit.  \\n\\nGiddy with success, she embraces him.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNobody followed us.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThat was incredible.\\n\\nAfter a moment, however, her smile fades.  Her eyes drift to \\nthe dagger in his belt.   \\n\\nDastan glances down at it as well.  He takes it out.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nThe quest for this dagger has \\nbrought tragedy to both of our \\nkingdoms.  It belongs in the hands \\nof those to whom it was entrusted.  \\nI make no claim on it. \\n\\nHe hands it to her.  \\n\\nON TAMINA, touched and overwhelmed by his gesture.   \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nShe steps up on tip toe and kisses him.  This time he’s not \\ntaken completely by surprise.  He kisses her back.\\n\\n\\x0c90.\\n\\nA movie star kiss…   \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nCome with me.  We’ll take the \\ndagger far away from here where it \\nwill be safe from your uncle.\\n\\nDastan is tempted.  But he shakes his head.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI can’t, Tamina.  I have to tell my \\nbrother about Nizam’s treachery and \\nclear my name.  \\n\\nTamina realizes what he intends and is suddenly worried.\\n\\nBetween you and your brother is an \\nentire army, Dastan!  You’ll be \\ndead before you ever reach him. \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI may not be first born, but I’m \\nstill the son of a King.  I have to \\ntry. \\n\\nHe takes a last look at her and turns to go.  \\n\\nTamina’s heart is in her throat.  She watches him walk away \\ninto the shadows…\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nWait…  \\n\\nShe catches up with him.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\nThe only way one man can evade one \\nhundred is with the help of the \\ngods.  \\n\\nShe takes out the dagger. \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nLet’s refill the dagger.\\n\\nHe stares at her.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nAre you sure?\\n\\n\\x0c91.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(smiles)\\n\\nMy people are enslaved but I’m \\nstill the daughter of a King.  I \\nmust try to free them.  I believe \\nthat you are our best hope, Dastan. \\n\\nThey share a look.  Dastan nods, buoyed by her faith in him.\\n\\nEXT. COURTYARD - MORNING\\n\\nThe SUN RISES, casting a sharp shadow over the ancient Sun \\nDIAL.  WE HEAR the sound of pickaxes rhythmically chopping at \\nstone and overseers cracking their whips as the excavation \\ncontinues… \\n\\nEXT. SECRET ENTRANCE - MORNING\\n\\nTamina leads Dastan to a distant corner of the courtyard.  \\nShe locates a brick with a faded image of a lion’s face and a \\nsun dial.  \\n\\nTamina mutters the words of an ancient incantation IN \\nFOREIGN, then places the palm of her hand on the sun dial and \\nturns it counter-clockwise…  CLICK.\\n\\nA beat.  A deep grinding sound as a secret door in the wall \\nslides open, revealing a narrow staircase descending into \\ndarkness…\\n\\nINT. SECRET ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER\\n\\nDastan follows Tamina down the stairs.  When they reach the \\nbottom, Tamina lights a torch.\\n\\nThe flames illuminate a musty passageway.   Hushed, echoing.  \\nAn underground RIVER flows somewhere out of sight.\\n\\nCarved into the stone wall is an enormous LION FACE, \\nprimitive and terrifying, superimposed on a sun dial.  \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThis place is sacred.  There’s a \\nritual for how you approach it.  \\nThe sun god will be angry if we \\ndon’t show respect.  Never touch \\nthe statues of the sun god.  It’s \\nforbidden.\\n\\n\\x0c92.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYour sun god is a lion?\\n\\n(off her reproachful look)\\nAll right!  I’ll just follow you.\\n\\nAs they pass the lion, Tamina bows to it and utters \\nrespectful prayers.  Dastan half-heartedly follows suit.\\n\\nTamina’s torch illuminates the stone floor as they go.  She \\ngrabs Dastan to stop him from stepping in a certain place.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDo you see that black paving-stone?\\n\\nDastan looks closely; he can make out a few flakes of what \\nmight have been black paint, a thousand years ago.\\n\\nI wouldn’t call it black.  Maybe \\nit’s a little bit darker than the \\nothers.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThe black stones represent man’s \\nwickedness.  Don’t step on them.  \\nIt’s forbidden. \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nForbidden.  You do not want to \\nanger the sun god.\\n\\nDASTAN\\nForbidden.  Okay.  I got it.\\n\\nDastan looks skeptical. \\n\\nShe leads the way down the passage.  Dastan follows.\\n\\nEXT. COURTYARD - DAY\\n\\nNizam oversees the dig.  He consults an ancient manuscript \\ncovered in Arabic script with drawings of an underground \\nhourglass and a dagger in the margin.  He closes it when \\nGarsiv arrives.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nWe have looked everywhere, my Lord…\\n\\n\\x0c93.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nIf you haven’t found them, you \\nhaven’t looked everywhere.  Keep \\nsearching.\\n\\nINT. BROKEN BRIDGE CHASM\\n\\nTamina and Dastan come to a halt at the edge of a water-\\nfilled chasm where a rope bridge used to be.  Remnants of \\nrope dangle uselessly from either side.  The rock wall has \\npartially collapsed, smashing the bridge and flooding the \\nchasm with water.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThey must have weakened that wall \\nwith their digging.  Now we can’t \\nget across.\\n\\nDastan’s eyes rove the far wall.\\n\\nDastan backs up for a running start.  Tamina grabs him.\\n\\nI think I can.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nDon’t be a fool.  You can’t jump \\nthat far.\\n\\nDASTAN\\nI know that.  I’m not crazy.\\n\\nHe sprints toward the edge… but instead of jumping the gap, \\nhe RUNS ALONG THE WALL for a good 20 feet… until gravity \\ncatches up with him, his feet slip-slide and he starts to \\nfall.\\n\\nDastan PUSHES OFF THE WALL with his feet, propelling himself \\nacross the gap -- GRABS a crevice in the rock wall opposite, \\nbarely saving himself from the plunge -- \\n\\n-- as SPIKES spring up below, breaking the surface of the \\nmuddy water covering the bottom of the pit.  Tamina gasps.\\n\\nDastan begins to rock-climb across the wall, using the most \\nminiscule hand and footholds.  He nearly falls -- more spikes \\nspring up below -- but he hangs on, keeps going.  Tamina \\nwatches, holding her breath.\\n\\n\\x0c94.\\n\\nAt last Dastan reaches the far wall.  It’s sheer, not a \\nhandhold in sight.  He gropes for one anyway.  His hand SLIPS \\non the slick rock.\\n\\nTamina can’t look…\\n\\nThe chasm is too wide at this end for Dastan to jump back to \\nthe opposite wall.  Nevertheless, he braces his feet against \\nthe rock -- and LAUNCHES himself out into space.\\n\\nSailing over the pit… he GRABS the end of the broken rope \\nbridge as he falls past it.  Hangs on, twisting and dangling.  \\nIt holds.\\n\\nDastan climbs up the rope bridge to safety.  Brushes himself \\noff, then looks proudly back at Tamina.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nHow do I get across?\\n\\nDastan looks around.  There’s no way.\\n\\nShe tosses the dagger across the chasm.  Dastan catches it.\\n\\nDASTAN\\nWe’ll figure something out.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nNo. You’re almost there.\\n\\n(she takes out the dagger)\\nIn the top of the hourglass is all \\ntime yet to come.  In the bottom is \\ntime past.  Between the two, it \\nnarrows to the width of a single \\nmoment:  the Now.  That is where \\nyou must insert the dagger’s tip.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\nThe handle will fill with sand as \\nit falls.  This is important:  take \\nthe dagger out as soon as it is \\nfull.  Do not leave it in the \\nhourglass for longer.\\n\\nTheir eyes meet across the chasm.  \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nJust make sure you’re here when I \\nget back.\\n\\nHe disappears.  Tamina watches him go.\\n\\n\\x0c95.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nWatch out for the black stones!\\n\\nEXT. COURTYARD - DAY\\n\\nA slave collapses from exhaustion.

HOURGLASS PASSAGEWAY\\n\\nDastan threads his way through a narrow corridor, stepping \\nover the occasional black tile.  With each step he takes, \\nnothing happens and he grows more confident.\\n\\nHe comes to another stone LION like the first. Sighing, he \\nedges past hugging the opposite wall, careful not to touch \\nit.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nPardon me, Lion, I humbly beg your \\npermission to pass.\\n\\n(a glance upward)\\n\\nGod forgive me -- but she believes \\nin it so what am I to do?\\n\\nDastan passes the lion and catches himself just about to step \\non a faded, black-painted stone.\\n\\nLooking ahead he realizes that half the paving stones in the \\ncorridor ahead of him are black.\\n\\nWith a martyred air, he hop-scotches down the corridor, from \\none safe stone to the next, until he reaches the alcove at \\nthe passageway’s midpoint.\\n\\nAs he pauses to take a breather, Dastan’s eye is drawn to a \\nMURAL depicting the LEGEND:  an angry sun god with a lion’s \\nhead, a blinding sandstorm, the hourglass…  Dastan gazes at \\nthe ancient images in wonder: maybe there’s more to this than \\nhe thought.\\n\\nDastan takes a deep breath and looks ahead; the second half \\nof the passageway is filled with even more black stones.\\n\\n\\x0c96.\\n\\nCarefully, he hops between the increasingly scarce safe \\nstones.  To avoid getting stranded, he’s forced to start \\nusing the walls, clinging to them like a rockclimber.\\n\\nAt last, the end of the black tiles comes into sight.  \\nGritting his teeth, he PUSHES off the wall with his feet, \\nJUMPS through the air, straining for distance--\\n\\nHe’s not going to make it.  Switching his landing to a dive \\nat the last instant, he hits the floor with both hands \\ninstead of his feet, tumbles-- and clears it!\\n\\nExhaling with relief, he gets to his feet…\\n\\nAnd hears an ominous “snick” he’s never heard before.  \\nLooking down he sees he’s standing right on a BLACK STONE.\\n\\nHe looks around for bad consequences.  Doesn’t see any.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nSorry lion.\\n\\nTHWIPP!!  A SCYTHE comes swinging down from the ceiling \\nbehind him.  Dastan jumps ASIDE, barely escaping being \\nbisected vertically -- only to land on another black stone.\\n\\nFWIPP!  A HORIZONTAL SCYTHE whips out from the wall at knee \\nlevel.  The blade just misses him as he JUMPS BACK -- \\n\\nTriggering TWO MORE HORIZONTAL SCYTHES on the opposite wall, \\none at neck level, one waist-high.  He escapes both by \\nTHROWING HIMSELF FLAT--\\n\\n-- Lands face down, only to hear the telltale “snick” of his \\nweight depressing yet another black stone.  Uh-oh…\\n\\nDastan ROLLS out of the way of one VERTICAL SCYTHE that whips \\nout of the floor -- lifts his legs just in time to escape \\ncastration by ANOTHER -- and SOMERSAULTS past a third.\\n\\nHe lands in a crouch, looking around in wild terror.  \\nMiraculously, he’s survived it all.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\n(very fast, heartfelt)\\nThere is no god but God, the \\nAlmighty, all-compassionate and all-\\nmerciful.

HOURGLASS CHAMBER\\n\\nDastan advances into the silent, natural cavern.\\n\\nA waterfall cascades down a sheer rock face into the darkness \\nof an abyss.  We HEAR an underground river rushing far below.\\n\\nTowering at the edge of the abyss is a titanic HOURGLASS.  It \\nseems to have grown out of the rock itself.  It holds \\nthousands of tons of glowing white sand that bathe the \\nchamber in an eerie light.\\n\\nFascinated, Dastan approaches.  He stares at the sand;  \\nthousands of millions of years worth of time -- no way to \\nfathom it.\\n\\nHe looks up at an ascending set of stairs carved into the \\nstone, leading to a rock promontory at the neck of the \\nhourglass…\\n\\nHe begins to climb the stairs.   At the top is a flat \\noutcropping of rock.  Above him looms the gigantic upper half \\nof the hourglass, a vast reservoir of glowing sand.\\n\\nDastan lies down and belly crawls until his head and \\nshoulders are over the edge of the abyss and he can reach the \\nneck of the hourglass.\\n\\nHe draws the dagger.  Holding it carefully, he brings its \\nblade to within an inch of the glass.\\n\\nDASTAN\\nGod is great.  Bismillah.\\n\\nHe pushes the dagger forward, with no idea what will happen.\\n\\nThe dagger’s point penetrates the thick glass, instantly \\nrendered liquid as quicksilver.  Dastan’s so startled he \\njerks it right back out again -- rendering the glass once \\nmore magically intact.\\n\\nDeliberately, Dastan repeats the action.  This time, he holds \\nthe dagger blade inside the hourglass, to catch the falling \\nsand.\\n\\nThe sand flows miraculously into the dagger blade and slowly, \\nbefore his eyes, the glass handle starts to fill…\\n\\n\\x0c98.\\n\\nEXT. COURTYARD/ IN THE PIT - DAY\\n\\nA pick-axe breaks through the rock shelf, triggering a \\nlandslide beneath the diggers’ feet.  With SHOUTS of alarm, \\nthey slide toward the bottom; their fellow diggers catch \\nthem, hanging on for dear life, and pull them to safety.\\n\\nINT. BROKEN BRIDGE CHASM\\n\\nTamina is startled to see new CRACKS suddenly appear in the \\nrock wall above the chasm.  WATER trickles through, \\nsuggesting a significant pressure build-up on the other side.\\n\\nTamina backs away… \\n\\nThe water BURSTS part of the wall, pours through in a \\ntorrent.\\n\\nINT. HOURGLASS CHAMBER\\n\\nDastan realizes he’s been holding his breath.  With a gasp, \\nhe pulls the dagger back.  It’s full of glowing sand.\\n\\nThe hourglass is as solid as if it had never been touched.\\n\\nINT. HOURGLASS PASSAGEWAY\\n\\nDastan hop-scothes back through the corridor, nimbly avoiding \\nthe black stones.\\n\\nUntil, he lands precariously on a narrow space between two \\nblack stones.  He loses his balance and reaches out to steady \\nhimself.  Unwittingly his hand touches…\\n\\nThe stone lion.  Dastan realizes what he’s done too late.  \\nSerrated IRON JAWS swing out from the horizontal slit of the \\nlion’s mouth.  Dastan hurdles over the jaws as they crunch \\ntogether like a giant bear-trap.\\n\\nAs Dastan runs, the corridor floor COLLAPSES under him.  \\nDesperately he increases his speed.  He can already see the \\nbroken bridge ahead.  In a few more strides, there’ll be no \\nfloor left to run on.  He makes a heroic RUNNING JUMP--\\n\\n…out into space, above the yawning chasm where the floor fell \\nin…\\n\\n\\x0c99.\\n\\n…And falls short. He can’t believe it.  After everything he’s \\nbeen through, this is how it ends -- plunging toward certain \\ndeath on JAGGED SPIKES below!\\n\\nAs he’s about to be impaled, he snatches the dagger from its \\nsheath --\\n\\nBOOM!! TIME STOPS -- the spikes inches from Dastan’s chest, \\nthe entire scene frozen except for the SAND spilling from the \\ndagger in Dastan’s hand… his finger on the jewel.  The sand \\nblows away like ash in the wind.\\n\\nREWIND!!\\n\\nTIME RUNS BACKWARD.  Dastan flies up away from the spikes, \\nthe corridor floor reassembling under his feet as he runs \\nbackwards, JUMPS backward over the lion-jaws as they open--\\n\\nUntil his hand releases the jewel.\\n\\nINT. HOURGLASS PASSAGEWAY [SECOND TIME]\\n\\nThis time, Dastan makes the landing and rights himself \\nWITHOUT touching the lion.  And he’s through, safely skirting \\nall the traps.\\n\\nINT. BROKEN BRIDGE CHASM\\n\\nWATER GUSHES IN, swelling the already flooded pit… while new \\ncracks pop up everywhere in the stressed rock wall.  Tamina \\nsees Dastan appear on the far side of the chasm.\\n\\nTAMINA\\nIt’s collapsing!\\n\\nDastan surveys the scene.  He sees that the rock wall is a \\nDAM ready to BURST--\\n\\nSuddenly the edge where Tamina is standing COLLAPSES!  She \\nfalls into the water.\\n\\nWithout hesitation, Dastan dives into the chasm and starts \\nswimming across, dodging falling rocks and swirling currents.\\n\\nTamina sees Dastan go under…\\xa0 she looks around desperately…\\n\\nDastan surfaces right in front of her.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTake a deep breath.\\n\\n\\x0c100.\\n\\nHe grabs Tamina and pulls her down into the water. \\n\\nTHE DAM BURSTS!  The wall caves in, a THUNDER OF ROCK and \\nWATER are unleashed.\\n\\nUNDERWATER:  The explosive current propels Dastan and Tamina \\nthrough a stone-walled channel -- Dastan takes Tamina’s hand, \\nkicks upward toward the LIGHT --\\n\\nEXT. RIVER - DAY\\n\\nDastan and Tamina surface in the river, below the citadel \\nwall.  They gasp for air.  As soon as they catch their \\nbreath…\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nYou used the dagger, didn’t you!\\n\\nBattered, half-dead with exhaustion, Dastan hoists himself \\nonto the embankment.   \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\nWe have only one minute of sand to \\nget to your brother!\\n\\nDastan looks at the dagger -- it’s half empty.\\n\\nJust then, he dodges instinctively as an ARROW misses his \\nhead by inches, imbeds in the wall behind him.  Defensively, \\nbefore Tamina can accuse him--\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nIt missed by itself.\\n\\nARCHERS assemble on the ramparts above.  Dastan and Tamina \\nrace up the stone steps of the embankment.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nI just had the strangest feeling \\nwe’ve done this before…\\n\\nDastan suddenly grabs her, yanks her back.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nWait.\\n\\nIn the next instant, a volley of ARROWS shoot past right in \\nfront of Tamina.  Dastan releases her.\\n\\n\\x0c101.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nNow.\\n\\nAs they continue their dash up the stairs--\\n\\nYou did it again, didn’t you!?\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nThat time I did.  Trust me, you \\nweren’t any happier the other way.\\n\\nINT. HOURGLASS CHAMBER - DAY\\n\\nThe majestic hourglass sits in silent darkness.\\n\\nSuddenly, a PICK breaks through the roof.  A shaft of \\nsunlight illuminates the chamber that has been dark for \\ncenturies.\\n\\nShouts of excitement from the workers above.  More picks chip \\nat the hole, raining down rocks and debris.\\n\\nTHE HOURGLASS: as the rocks strike its surface, it begins to \\nresonate like a great warning bell…\\n\\nEXT. ROOFTOPS - DAY\\n\\nTamina takes Dastan’s arm, points to the ROYAL PALACE \\nstanding on the other side of a deep mountain gorge.  A \\nnarrow stone bridge below is the only way across the chasm.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThat’s the palace just across that \\nbridge.  I know a place--\\n\\nDastan tackles her to the ground as a SPEAR hurtles through \\nthe space where they were just standing.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n(not without pride)\\nGod, our soldiers are good!\\n\\nTamina looks, sees--\\n\\nA DOZEN SOLDIERS running toward them across the rooftops.  \\nMore on their way, throwing up ladders as they climb.\\n\\n\\x0c102.\\n\\nDastan yanks Tamina to her feet.  With the army on their \\nheels, they improvise a rapid descent via stairs, ladders and \\nfree-fall to the bridge level.\\n\\nAs they climb down the final ladder (Tamina first), more \\nsoldiers run toward them from the bridge.  Dastan and Tamina \\nare trapped between the new arrivals and the soldiers above.\\n\\nDastan reaches for the DAGGER.  Tamina stops him.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nDastan grits his teeth.  All right, he’ll do it the hard way.\\n\\nHe PUSHES OFF the wall with the ladder, LANDS in a judo roll \\nthat FLIPS the ladder over him-- tossing Tamina over the \\nheads of the soldiers in front of them.  Dastan continues his \\nmomentum, POLE-VAULTING over Tamina on the ladder.  This \\nmaster-stroke puts all the soldiers behind them, leaving them \\na clear path to the bridge.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nRun.\\n\\nEXT. STONE BRIDGE - DAY\\n\\nDastan and Tamina make a mad dash across the bridge.  They’re \\nmore than halfway there when MORE SOLDIERS appear on the far \\nside.  Dastan comes to a skidding stop.\\n\\nHe looks back:  they’re trapped on a long, narrow stone \\nbridge between two armies, above a vertigo-inducing ravine \\nplunging ten thousand feet below.\\n\\nDASTAN\\nShould have used the dagger.\\n\\nWith a communal ROAR, the soldiers charge from both sides.\\n\\nDastan swings into action.  Snatching up a rope coil, he \\nswiftly ties it around a parapet of the bridge wall…\\n\\n…and draws his sword as the soldiers descend on them.\\n\\nHopelessly outnumbered, Dastan and Tamina leap onto the \\nbridge wall and run BACK the way they came-- Dastan parrying \\nsword blows and uncoiling rope as he runs.    \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nYou can’t possibly--\\n\\n\\x0c103.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nHold tight.\\n\\nTamina locks her arms around Dastan just in time -- he JUMPS!\\n\\nTHEY PLUMMET ON THE ROPE TOWARDS THE BOTTOMLESS GORGE!\\n\\nThe rope stops their fall; they start swinging back toward \\nthe far side of the bridge-- incredibly, straight for a tiny \\nARCHER’S LOOPHOLE in the sheer fortress wall opposite.  \\nDastan’s aim was brilliant.\\n\\nBut not perfect.\\n\\nThey slam into the wall below the loophole.  It’s just out of \\ntheir reach.  As they start swinging back--\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nClimb higher!  We’ll make it on the \\nnext swing!\\n\\nTamina and Dastan desperately climb up a few feet on the \\nrope.  ARCHERS on the bridge above them unleash a volley of \\narrows, which miss, but don’t make their task any easier.\\n\\nThey reach the apex of their backswing, begin their return \\ntoward the loophole… Dastan reaches out to grab it--\\n\\nOnly this time, they don’t even reach the wall. They’ve lost \\ntoo much momentum.\\n\\nDastan and Tamina swing uselessly back and forth, in a \\nsmaller arc each time.  They’re trapped at the end of the \\nrope.  Hanging off a bridge that’s full of soldiers.\\n\\nWIDE SHOT\\n\\nOops.\\n\\nON THE BRIDGE\\n\\nA soldier (call him the EXECUTIONER) mounts the parapet where \\nDastan tied the rope.  He draws a wicked scimitar, raises it \\nhigh-- and CHOPS!\\n\\nDASTAN and TAMINA are shaken.  One more cut will sever the \\nrope.\\n\\nTAMINA\\nAll right.  Use the dagger.\\n\\n\\x0c104.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nOh I don’t know, I think we can get \\nout of this one.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nUse the dagger!  NOW!!\\n\\nThe Executioner raises his scimitar for the coup de grace…\\n\\nDastan releases one hand from the rope, uses it to pull \\nTamina toward him and gives her a passionate kiss.\\n\\nThe sword cuts the rope: Dastan and Tamina plunge into the \\nabyss… then Dastan HITS the jewel.\\n\\nREWIND!\\n\\nReversing through the kiss, and all their back-and-forth \\nswings, wider each time, until they land back up on--\\n\\nEXT. STONE BRIDGE - DAY [SECOND TIME]\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nHold tight.\\n\\nExactly as before, Tamina locks her arms around Dastan as he \\nJUMPS from the parapet.\\n\\nOnly this time, he adjusts his aim, hastily CLIMBING the rope \\nas they swing…\\xa0hits the loophole, grabs and pulls them in!\\n\\nEXT. STONE BRIDGE - DAY\\n\\nThe EXECUTIONER stares down into the gorge, dumbfounded, at \\nthe empty rope swinging below the bridge.  They’ve escaped.\\n\\nINT. LOOPHOLE CORRIDOR - DAY\\n\\nTamina and Dastan land together on the floor.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nThat was fantastic!\\n(hesitates)\\n\\nYou didn’t use the dagger, did you?\\n\\nDASTAN\\nWhat?  No!  Of course not…\\n\\n\\x0c105.\\n\\nShe’s not sure she believes him but there’s no time for \\ndiscussion.  They set off down the hall.\\n\\nEXT. EXCAVATION PIT - DAY\\n\\nNizam stands on a platform and watches the slaves construct a \\nplatform that can be lowered to the Hourglass far below.   \\n\\nGarsiv gallops up, dismounting before his horse comes to a \\nstop.  He runs to the edge of the pit.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nMy Lord Nizam!  Dastan and the girl \\nhave been spotted.  They just \\nslipped past a company of soldiers \\nnear the Royal Palace.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nThe Royal Palace… Where is King \\nTus?\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nReturning from a hunt.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\n(climbing out)\\n\\nSend word that I must speak to him.   \\nDastan must not reach him first.\\n\\nINT. PALACE BACK STAIRS/CORRIDORS - DAY\\n\\nDastan and Tamina race up stairs, through corridors, etc.  \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nI hope you know where you’re going.\\n\\nTamina throws open the small wooden door of a supply closet… \\nthey duck inside.  She closes the door, plunging them into \\ndarkness.  \\n\\nWE HEAR their breathing, rapid and shallow… then the click of \\na hidden latch and another door swings open--\\n\\nINT. SECRET ROOM - SUNSET\\n\\nTamina lights a lantern revealing a cozy room, rich with \\ncurtains and draperies, a tea service and silk cushions.\\n\\n\\x0c106.\\n\\nA secret getaway…?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nFor the king.  I was a nosy little \\ngirl, always getting into places I \\nwasn’t supposed to…\\n\\nShe parts a curtain, revealing a short passageway that dead-\\nends in a door.  Tamina slides open a peephole and looks…\\n\\nPOV THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE:\\n\\nServants fill the royal baths with hot water.  Tamina steps \\naside to let Dastan look.\\xa0 \\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\nThe King’s private bath.  They’re \\npreparing it for him now.  When \\nyour brother returns, you’ll have a \\nchance to speak to him alone. \\n\\nShe walks back into the secret room.  Dastan follows.  He \\nopens the shutter to look out the small window… \\n\\nOn the stone bridge far below he sees dozens of soldiers \\nrunning around searching for the escaped fugitives.\\n\\nDastan turns and looks at Tamina.  She is absently brushing \\nher hair in front of a mirror-- the first chance she’s had in \\na long time.    \\n\\nHe’s gazing at her, transfixed.  She catches him looking in \\nthe mirror and turns.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nWhat?   \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou look beautiful.\\n\\nShe blushes.  He steps closer.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nYou know, when this is all over.  \\nIf we succeed…  perhaps you and I--\\n\\nTamina stops him.  \\n\\n\\x0c107.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(sadly)\\n\\nIt is not meant to be between us, \\nDastan.\\n\\nWhy not?  \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\n(takes a deep breath)\\n\\nBecause.  I am the Princess of \\nAlamut and we have traditions…\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(suddenly defensive)\\n\\nAnd I’m only a fourth son?\\n\\nTAMINA \\n\\nThat has nothing to do with it.  \\nAccording to our ancient and \\nimmutable beliefs, I can only marry \\none who has been baptized in the \\nsacred fountain of Alamut.  It has \\nbeen this way for centuries.\\n\\nOh. So all I have to do is get \\nbaptized in this fountain?  I don’t \\nthink the Prophet forbids a little \\ndip-- \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nYou don’t understand.  You can’t be \\nbaptized-- nobody can, ever again.  \\nThe sacred fountain of Alamut has \\nbeen destroyed.  \\n\\nShe shakes her head.\\n\\nDastan brightens.\\n\\nHe falls silent.  Oh.  That’s a tougher problem.\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\n(wistfully)\\nI’m sorry, Dastan.\\n\\nDastan searches for the right words. Then…\\n\\nA HORN BLAST outside signals the king’s arrival.  They hurry \\nto the window in time to see:\\n\\n\\x0c108.\\n\\nTUS and a half-dozen GUARDS ride across the bridge.\\n\\nMy brother.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTAMINA \\n\\nYou should prepare yourself.  \\n\\nINT. ROYAL PALACE - NIGHT\\n\\nTus and his bodyguards stride across the great hall.  A YOUNG \\nGUARD steps forward and bows.\\n\\nGUARD\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nMy King.  Nizam sends word that he \\nwould speak with you.\\n\\nI’ve been riding all day.  I’ll see \\nhim after I’ve bathed and changed.\\n\\nINT. ROYAL BATHS - NIGHT\\n\\nSTEAM fills the room.  The King’s guards watch the ATTENDANTS \\nprepare the bath in a centuries-old Eastern ritual.\\n\\nAT THE SECRET ENTRANCE\\n\\nDastan watches through the peephole, rehearsing nervously \\nunder his breath.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n‘It was not I who killed our \\nfather.’  Can’t start with that.  \\n‘My brother, it is I, Dastan.  I \\ncome to you in peace…’  No time for \\nthat; get to the point!  ‘My \\nbrother…’ That’s a good start.\\n\\nDASTAN’S POV - the guards escort the attendants out.  Moments \\nlater, Tus enters.  The guards leave him alone to his bath.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\n‘My brother…’ ‘My noble brother…’\\n\\nDastan turns and locks eyes with Tamina one last time; she \\ngives him an encouraging nod…  Dastan presses on the door…\\n\\nIN THE BATHS\\n\\n\\x0c109.\\n\\nThe secret door, invisible in the tiled wall, opens.  Dastan \\nsteps through silently and disappears into the steam.\\n\\nTUS takes off his robe and lowers himself into the steaming \\nwater.  Rinses his face and hair and sinks down.  He closes \\nhis eyes…\\n\\nSuddenly he feels a draft.  Frowns.  Opens his eyes…\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nMy noble brother.\\n\\nTus splashes to his feet, waist-high in the water.\\n\\nGUARDS!\\n\\nNo!\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nGUARDS!!!\\n\\nDastan throws his sword aside.  Holds up his hands-- unarmed.\\n\\nThe GUARDS burst in and seize Dastan\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nYou have nothing to fear from me.  \\nWhat Nizam told you is a lie.  He \\nkilled Father.  It was Nizam who \\npoisoned the robe.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nTus, Nizam deceived us all.  He \\nmade us conquer Alamut so he could \\npossess its secrets!  And if you \\ntry to stop him, he will kill you \\ntoo!\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nEnough!!\\n\\nEveryone falls silent.  Dastan ceases struggling and waits in \\nsuspense for Tus’s next words.\\n\\nTUS (CONT'D)\\nWe are brothers.  Since childhood \\nI’ve known you as I know myself.  I \\ncan tell by how artfully you’ve \\nrehearsed your speech that you are \\nlying.\\n\\n(MORE)\\n\\n\\x0cTUS (CONT'D)\\n\\n(to the guards)\\n\\nTake him to Nizam.\\n\\n110.\\n\\nANGLE ON TAMINA - watching through the peephole, dismayed.\\n\\nTus turns away as the guards drag Dastan off.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNo!  Tus, listen to me, I’m not \\nmaking this up!  TUS!!\\n\\nTus never looks back.  Dastan appeals to the guards:\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nI beg you.  One minute.  Let me \\nspeak to him.  As you love him, as \\nyou loved your king--\\n\\nThe CAPTAIN of the guards punches him in the head.\\n\\nNow Dastan’s mad.  With a herculean effort, he yanks free, \\njust enough to draw the dagger from his belt--\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\n\\nShut up, you.\\n\\nGUARD\\n\\nHe’s got a knife.\\n\\n--and hits the JEWEL.  BOOM!! TIME STANDS STILL.\\n\\nREWIND!\\n\\nINT. ROYAL BATHS - NIGHT [SECOND TIME]\\n\\nTus takes off his robe, lowers himself into the steaming \\nbath.  Rinses his face and hair, just as he did before.\\n\\nA NOISE makes Tus turn.  Dastan has just BARRICADED the door \\nwith a medieval two-by-four.  Tus splashes to his feet.  This \\ntime, the first thing Dastan does is throw his sword away.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTus, don’t call the guards yet.  \\nListen to me.\\n\\nGUARDS!!\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nDastan winces; continues, improvising…\\n\\n\\x0c111.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nBeneath this citadel is an ancient, \\nmystical force beyond anything you \\ncan imagine.  It’s the hourglass \\nthat contains the Sands of Time.\\n\\nSOUNDS of the guards beating at the barricaded door--\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nThis dagger holds only a minute’s \\nworth of the sand.\\n\\nHe draws the dagger, forgetting it’s a weapon too--\\n\\nHastily turning the dagger around-- this isn’t going well.\\n\\nCoward!  Do you attack me thus, \\nunarmed?\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNo!\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nNizam is after the hourglass and \\nthe dagger.  He tricked us into \\nfalsely invading a kingdom that has \\ndone us no wrong.  To hide his \\nlies, he murdered our father and \\nthrew the blame on me.\\n\\nThe door gives way; the guards burst in.  Dastan doesn’t have \\nto wait for Tus’s verdict to know he’s blown it.\\n\\nHe jumps back, using the dagger to hold the guards at bay.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\n(angry with himself)\\n\\nDamn it!\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nStand back!  I warn you!\\n\\nThe guards hesitate, perplexed.  In a second they’ll realize \\nthere’s no real threat and rush him.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nI need a minute.  Just give me a \\nminute to think.\\n\\nHe looks at the dagger in his hand -- nearly empty.  Just \\nenough sand for one last rewind.\\n\\n\\x0cSuddenly, desperately, he looks at Tus.  He knows what to do.\\n\\n112.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nTus, this is no ordinary dagger.  \\nTouch this jewel on its handle and \\nyou will learn Alamut’s greatest \\nsecret.\\n\\nTUS\\n(to the guards)\\n\\nEnough!  Take him to Nizam.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(to Tus)\\n\\nIf you won’t believe me, then our \\nkingdom is forfeit.  Our honor is \\nforfeit.  And I’m better off dead.\\n\\nAs the guards move forward, Dastan swiftly brings the \\ndagger’s blade to his own throat.  Again, they hesitate.\\n\\nDastan PLUNGES the dagger into his own heart.  Under the \\nastonished stares of the guards, he crumples to his knees.  \\nBlood appears on his lips.  He falls dead.\\n\\nON TAMINA - who stifles a cry.\\n\\nTus shakes off the guard who’s just helped him put on his \\nrobe.  He advances toward his brother’s body.\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\n\\nMy lord, if it’s a trick…\\n\\nTus turns Dastan over.  He’s dead, the hilt of the dagger \\nprotruding from his chest.  Tus pulls it out.  The blade is \\nwet with blood.\\n\\nTus examines the dagger.  The unearthly, glowing white sand \\ninside its handle.  For a moment we think he’s going to do \\nsomething with it-- but he just lays the dagger back down on \\nthe floor.\\n\\nON TAMINA - who pulls away from the peephole, tears streaming \\ndown her face.  She can’t look.\\n\\nThe Captain tries to escort Tus out of the baths, but Tus \\nlingers, troubled.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nHe took his own life.\\n\\n\\x0c113.\\n\\nCAPTAIN\\n\\nA coward’s way out.\\n\\nTUS\\nMy brother was no coward.\\n\\nHe bends and picks up the dagger again.  Presses the jewel…\\n\\nTIME STOPS!  The last sands fall from the dagger; a draft \\nblows them away through the steam frozen in midair…\\n\\nREWIND!\\n\\nINT. ROYAL BATHS - NIGHT [THIRD TIME]\\n\\nThe guards close in on Dastan, just as they did before.  Tus \\nwhirls, bewildered by deja vu:  what’s happening here?\\n\\nAs he did before, Dastan dramatically holds the dagger to his \\nown throat -- unaware that the final rewind has already \\nhappened and that the dagger is empty.\\n\\nTus lunges at Dastan, GRABS his arm just in time to prevent \\nhim from stabbing himself.  The guards pull them apart.\\n\\nCowed by the royal command in his voice, the guards obey.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nIf you won’t believe me, then our \\nkingdom is forfeit.  Our honor is \\nforfeit.  And I’m better off dead.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nLet him go!!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nThanks brother.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\n(wonderment)\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nBlood?  What blood?\\n\\nYou were dead.  I saw the blood.\\n\\nPerplexed, he looks down at the dagger in his hand.  He \\nnearly faints on seeing that it’s empty.  Tus, overcome by \\nemotion, clasps Dastan in a warm embrace.\\n\\n\\x0c114.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nMy brother.  On the day we left for \\nwar, our father told me:  ‘A king \\nshould listen always to the voice \\nof reason-- but also listen to your \\nheart.’  My heart knew you could \\nnot have done what they accused you \\nof.  I should have listened.\\n\\nDastan nods, still a bit shaky.  Tus turns.\\n\\nTUS (CONT'D)\\nSend for a detachment of soldiers \\nfrom my most trusted regiment.\\n\\nThe Captain nods and exits.  Tus turns back to Dastan.\\n\\nTUS (CONT'D)\\n\\nCome.  We must find Nizam.   \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nOne more thing, brother.  There is \\nsomebody I want you to meet…\\n\\nDastan turns toward the secret door as…\\n\\nTAMINA emerges like a vision from the steam.\\n\\nTus looks at his younger brother, impressed:  where’d you get \\nher?\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nIt’s a long story.\\n\\nEXT. STONE BRIDGE - NIGHT\\n\\nThunder rumbles in an ominous sky.  Tus, Dastan and Tamina \\nstride across the bridge accompanied by FOUR ROYAL GUARDS.\\n\\nNizam appears at the end of the bridge with his own \\ndetachment of SIX ELITE GUARDS led by Garsiv.\\n\\nAs the two small groups come together, Nizam speaks first.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nKeep your swords sheathed.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nO King!\\n\\n\\x0c115.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nNizam, you have committed treason \\nand murder and have conspired to \\ncast the blame on my brother. \\n\\n(to Garsiv)\\n\\nCaptain of the Guards, I order you \\nto arrest this traitor.\\n\\nGarsiv steps forward and looks Nizam in the eye… then he \\nturns and nods to the GUARDS surrounding Tus…\\n\\nTus’s own guards grab him, Dastan and Tamina, bind their \\nhands behind their backs and force them to their knees!\\n\\nTUS (CONT'D)\\n\\nWho dares lay a hand on Tus, son of \\nShahraman, your King!\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nI have heard that name enough.\\n\\nNizam glances at Garsiv who plucks Dastan’s sword from him \\nand raises it high…\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNO!!!\\n\\nGarsiv brings the sword slashing down.  We don’t see the \\nimpact, only the men’s reactions.\\n\\nTus lies dead on the stone bridge, a spreading pool of blood \\nbeneath him in the light rain.\\n\\nGarsiv throws the sword down.  It clatters next to Dastan.\\n\\nA CLATTERING OF HOOVES signals the arrival of the detachment \\nof loyal soldiers with the CAPTAIN sent to fetch them.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nYour sword…  \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nHo!  Help!  Murder!!\\n\\nDastan opens his mouth to protest but Garsiv’s men silence \\nhim with a rain of kicks and blows.  As the loyal SOLDIERS \\narrive on the scene, Nizam steps forward in apparent anguish.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\nGod help us!  We arrived too late.  \\nOur King is dead-- slain by Dastan, \\nwho killed his father.\\n\\n\\x0cDastan tries to speak but Garsiv’s men redouble their blows.\\n\\n116.\\n\\nHe’s lying!  Dastan is innocent!\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\nThis is the daughter of our enemy!  \\nHe would have conspired with her to \\nlead the people of this city \\nagainst us!\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\n(steps in)\\n\\nI shall take charge of questioning \\nDastan and his accomplice.  I will \\nfind out the full extent of this \\nconspiracy.\\n\\nAn angry murmur rises from among the detachment of loyal \\nsoldiers, eager for revenge on their king’s murderer.\\n\\nGarsiv and his men hustle Tamina and Dastan along the bridge, \\ndrowning their protests… leaving the Captain and the soldiers \\nstaring mournfully down at Tus’s body in the rain.\\n\\nINT. DUNGEON - NIGHT\\n\\nTamina and Dastan are shoved into a cell and chained to the \\nwall.  The guards exit.  \\n\\nNizam steps forward and lifts the DAGGER from Dastan’s belt.  \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nYou squandered your opportunity, \\nDastan.  You stood before the \\nhourglass with the dagger in your \\nhand, yet the limit of your \\nambition was to turn back time \\nsixty seconds?  \\n\\nHe shakes his head.\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nTo do more is forbidden!\\n\\nNizam ignores her; continues speaking to Dastan.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nA failure of imagination.  I will \\nuse it to change my destiny. \\n\\n\\x0c117.\\n\\nYou mean usurp my father’s place.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nHad I not saved his life, the \\nthrone was rightfully mine.  I \\nshall merely go back and let nature \\ntake its course.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nMy father treated you with nothing \\nbut love and honor.  And this is \\nhow you repay him?\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nLove and honor? I lived under his \\nthumb my entire life!  You of all \\npeople should understand what \\nthat’s like, nephew-- to be better \\nand smarter than your brothers, yet \\nto live in their shadow because of \\nthe accident of birth? \\n\\nI would not betray my family to \\nchange my place.\\n\\nI felt the same way when I was your \\nage, Dastan.  Trust me-- it wears \\nthin over time.   \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nNizam, you cannot do this!  You \\nwill anger the sun god! \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nSuperstition, girl.  \\n\\n(to Dastan)\\n\\nForeknowledge of the future will \\nmake me the wisest of rulers-- \\nlaying in grain before the famine \\ncomes, building high walls when \\nthere is yet no enemy in sight… I \\nshall be a great king. It’s \\nunfortunate that you will not be \\nborn to reap this golden age, \\nDastan.  You were the only one in \\nthe family I ever liked. \\n\\nAs Nizam leaves he summons the GUARDS.\\n\\n\\x0c118.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\n\\nUnchain the girl.  I promised \\nGarsiv he could have her to enjoy.\\n\\n(apologetic to Dastan)\\nI have to keep him happy for a \\nlittle longer.\\n\\nTamina is freed and dragged away, struggling.   \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNizam!  Nizam!  NIZAM!!\\n\\nHe ducks under one of the chains, turning himself around so \\nhe’s facing the wall with his arms crossed.  He repeats the \\nmaneuver, each time giving the chains another twist, until \\nhe’s close enough to brace his feet against the wall.  Then \\nPULLS until he’s screaming in agony.\\n\\nINT. DUNGEON - LATER\\n\\nDastan is barely conscious.  His chains haven’t budged.\\n\\nThe distant NOISE of a door closing half-rouses him.  \\nDastan’s lips are parched, his eyes glassy and delirious…\\n\\nDASTAN\\nTamina…  Tamina…\\n\\nGuards enter and unchain him from the wall.  Dastan is limp \\nand unresisting, unaware of what’s happening.\\n\\nGUARD\\n\\nHe’s half-dead already. Why bother \\nwith an execution?\\n\\nINT. DUNGEON CORRIDOR - NIGHT\\n\\nPrisoners stare through the bars as the guards drag Dastan \\nout.  The cells are packed with MEN of Alamut, sullen and \\nfierce.\\n\\nFarood, slumped disconsolately in a cell with the other \\nnomads is appalled to recognize Dastan.  \\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nAli?!  They got you too?\\n\\nAs Dastan passes, Farood grips the bars, shouts--\\n\\n\\x0c119.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\nAli, I am sorry.  We should never \\nhave come to this city! \\n\\nDastan springs into action, revealing that he’s been playing \\npossum.  Using his chains as weapons, he attacks the guards.  \\nMore guards pour in, shouting for back up.  \\n\\nDastan is a one-man army, fighting six at once in the narrow \\ncorridor.  Unable to rid himself of his chains, he loops them \\nover a ceiling hook and becomes a circus acrobat, spinning \\nand KICKING off the walls to clobber one guard after another.\\n\\nThe prisoners rush to the bars, their shouts adding to the \\nfearsome din.  The little Gypsy Boy stares with open-mouthed \\nhero worship.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nAli, you amaze me!\\n\\nOne unlucky guard, flung against the bars, is grabbed by \\nFarood’s daughters, who tie him in place with his own turban.\\n\\nNomad hands reach through the bars, frisk the guard.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nGet his keys!\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nNothing!\\n\\nDastan clobbers another guard, sends him Farood’s way.  The \\nnomad women frisk the guard-- no luck.  More soldiers arrive, \\nmaking things hotter for Dastan every moment.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nTry the fat one there!\\n\\nINT. TENT - NIGHT\\n\\nGarsiv enters and gazes at Tamina seated on low cushions, her \\nwrists bound.   Without taking his eyes off of her, he speaks \\nto the guard:\\n\\nGARSIV\\nUntie her.  And leave us.\\n\\n\\x0c120.\\n\\nINT. DUNGEON CORRIDOR - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan fights desperately, outnumbered.  Farood comes up \\ntriumphantly holding KEYS.\\n\\nI got it!\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nSo open something!!\\n\\nFarood methodically tries one key after the next to open the \\nnomads’ cell, while Dastan battles to stay alive.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nTell me Ali, what was your crime?\\n\\nDastan doesn’t have time to breathe, much less answer, as he \\ndodges a killing blow from another guard.\\n\\nDastan’s in trouble, three guards strangling him with his own \\nchains…\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\nAh your hands are full.  You will \\nnever believe how I came to be in \\nthis awful place.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nI was arrested for ‘war \\nprofiteering!’ Can you believe \\nthat?  A man comes to do business \\nand he is punished for fair trade-- \\nah here it is.   \\n\\nFarood unlocks the cell.  The nomads swarm out and overwhelm \\nthe guards, rescuing Dastan in the nick of time.\\n\\nFAROOD’S DAUGHTERS finish them off with savage gusto. \\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nYou see?  I told you they were \\nstrong!\\n\\nDastan, Farood and the nomads hurry down the corridor, past \\ncells packed with men of Alamut who rattle the bars and shout \\nin Foreign at the escaping prisoners.\\n\\nDastan pauses on the threshold of freedom.  Looks back. \\n\\n\\x0c121.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nAli-- come!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nNo.  These men are prisoners \\nbecause of me.  I am a king’s son.\\n\\n(nods understandingly)\\n\\nA blow on the head can cause such \\ndelusions.  Fresh air and freedom \\nare the cure.\\n\\nHe pulls at Dastan’s arm but Dastan shakes him off.  To \\nFarood’s horror, Dastan takes the keys and unlocks the first \\ncell…\\n\\nWith a ROAR, the prisoners charge out.  Dastan climbs onto a \\nbarrel and shouts over the commotion.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nMen of Alamut, hear me!  It is \\nDastan, prince of Nasaf, who calls \\nto you!\\n\\nFarood winces-- this delusion is worse than he thought.  The \\nmen of Alamut react with angry mutters that swell \\ndangerously.\\n\\nFarood is startled as it dawns on him… Dastan is a prince!  \\nHis expression transforms to one of respect and awe.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\n\\nWell may you hate me-- as a \\nforeigner, as an invader.  Were I \\nin your place, my blood would cry \\nout for vengeance for your \\nconquered land.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nYet my land too is conquered-- from \\nwithin, by a usurper.  Help me \\ndefeat him, and I will give you \\nback your kingdom.  I swear it in \\nthe name of my father, Shahraman!\\n\\nDastan pauses for effect.  Farood whispers in his ear:\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nAli, they don’t understand your \\nlanguage.\\n\\n\\x0c122.\\n\\nDismayed, Dastan surveys his audience, realizes it’s true.\\n\\nAt that moment several of the Alamut men succeed in smashing \\nopen the ARMORY.  Spears and weapons are passed out.  Dastan \\nand Farood are in the center of a hostile, well-armed mob…\\n\\nJust then, a battalion of Nasaf SOLDIERS charge in, diverting \\nthe prisoners’ attention.  \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n(with hand gestures)\\n\\nFight them!  No, them!\\n\\nA full scale battle erupts.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nAli!  Well said.  Now let’s get out \\nof here.\\n\\nDastan doesn’t argue this time.  Taking advantage of the \\nconfusion, they slip out of the melee.\\n\\nEXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT\\n\\nDastan, Farood and the nomads emerge through a narrow doorway \\nonto the citadel embankment, above the river.  Farood \\nbreathes in the free air--\\n\\nDastan pushes him down just in time to dodge a hail of \\narrows.  Nasaf SOLDIERS on horseback ride to intercept them.\\n\\nDastan and the nomad bandits throw themselves into a pitched \\nbattle.  The Giant Bandit fights three soldiers at once; he \\nplucks one from the saddle and hurls him to an icy fate in \\nthe river below. \\n\\nDastan gets hold of the horse and swings into the saddle.  \\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nFarood.  Hold them as long as you \\ncan.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\n(offended)\\n\\nNow that you’re a king’s son, you \\nare leaving us?\\n\\nDASTAN\\nFarood!  I need to save her!\\n\\n\\x0c123.\\n\\nFAROOD\\n\\nBukbuk?  Why didn’t you say so?\\n\\nDastan smiles.  As he prepares to depart:\\n\\nA new wave of NASAF SOLDIERS gallops toward them.  The nomads \\nare desperately outnumbered…  but then:\\n\\nThe faces of the Nasaf Soldiers shift from glee to fear as…\\n\\nThe just-liberated Alamut men surge from the prison with a \\nterrifying ROAR!  Farood grins.\\n\\nFAROOD (CONT'D)\\n\\nGo!\\n\\nDastan gallops off.\\n\\nEXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT\\n\\nGuards open the door to an iron CAGE suspended with ropes and \\npulleys over the pit.  Nizam steps inside and they begin to \\nlower him toward the hourglass… \\n\\nINT. GARSIV’S TENT - NIGHT\\n\\nGarsiv ducks as Tamina throws a vase at his head.  He laughs \\nand pursues her around the bed.\\n\\nGARSIV\\nA feisty one, aren’t you?\\n\\nCRASH!  The next vase connects with his face.  He finds that \\nslightly less amusing.  Shakes it off and gives chase…\\n\\nEXT. GARSIV’S TENT, COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS\\n\\nTamina bursts out of the tent with Garsiv on her heels.  She \\nmakes it about twenty feet before he brings her down with a \\ntackle from behind.\\n\\nHe forces her onto her back and pins her arms.\\n\\nGARSIV\\nNot so cocky now, are we?\\n\\nDASTAN (V.O.)\\n\\nGARSIV!\\n\\n\\x0c124.\\n\\nHe turns as Dastan rides up and leaps from his horse.\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nYou always said you’d take me in a \\nreal fight instead of a contest; \\nnow’s your chance.  \\n\\nTwo GUARDS arrive and fit arrows to their bows, ready to \\nshoot Dastan.  Garsiv holds up a hand.\\n\\nNo.  I want to kill him myself.\\n\\nGARSIV\\n\\n(to Dastan)\\n\\nI’ve waited a long time for this \\nmoment, Dastan.     \\n\\nHe hands Tamina off to another pair of guards who pin her \\narms tightly. \\n\\nGARSIV (CONT'D)\\n\\nLet her watch.\\n\\nGarsiv draws his sword.  Dastan draws his.  They circle one \\nanother for several moments.\\n\\nThen the two fighters fall upon one another in a fury of \\nsteel-on-steel.  It’s a perfect match of skill, determination \\nand mutual hatred.\\n\\nBack and forth they battle, trading blows and parries.  \\nDastan is quicker but Garsiv is the stronger.  With every \\nblow, Dastan loses a little edge.  Garsiv gradually begins to \\nforce Dastan backwards, toward the edge of the pit…\\n\\nTAMINA struggles against the two Guards holding her tight.\\n\\nGarsiv gives Dastan a vicious kick to the stomach that sends \\nhim to the ground.  Garsiv smiles, moving in for the kill.\\n\\nGARSIV (CONT'D)\\nThis is not a tournament Dastan.  \\nYour fancy tricks won’t save you \\nnow.\\n\\nDastan scrambles to his feet in time to block the attack but \\nhe’s on his heels, his back to the edge of the massive pit.  \\nWith a powerful blow, Garsiv knocks Dastan’s sword from his \\nhand.  Dastan is helpless, on the brink of the precipice.\\n\\nGarsiv takes one last big, two-handed swing at Dastan, aiming \\nto cut him in half.  Dastan does an impossible back bend over \\nthe pit, like a limbo dancer, hanging by his toes…\\n\\n\\x0c125.\\n\\nSWOOSH!  Garsiv’s sword slices air inches above Dastan’s \\nnose!  His momentum carries Garsiv around like a baseball \\nslugger missing a strike…\\n\\nDastan spins low on one pivot foot, extending the opposite \\nleg… hitting GARSIV at the back of the knees-- TOPPLING him \\nover the cliff edge face forwards!\\n\\nTamina’s GUARDS step forward with a gasp, as if they could \\ncatch Garsiv… MISTAKE.\\n\\nTamina plucks a sword from a Guard’s belt.  In a flash, she \\nstrikes them down. \\n\\nThe other two Guards turn to face her, warily.   Dastan \\nscrambles to his feet and starts to come to her aid--\\n\\nTamina raises her sword to fight the two guards.  \\n\\nTAMINA\\nNever mind me.  Stop Nizam!\\n\\nTAMINA (CONT'D)\\n\\nGO!\\n\\nINT. HOURGLASS CHAMBER - NIGHT\\n\\nWith a cranking of wheels, the CAGE comes to a halt in front \\nof the hourglass.  Crumbling rockslides and running water \\ncreate a non-stop shower of debris falling around the chamber \\nand into the abyss.  Nizam pays no attention, staring in \\nwonder at the bright sand, inches from his face.  He feels \\nthe solid glass…\\n\\nNIZAM\\n(closes his eyes)\\n\\nThis is my destiny…\\n\\nHe raises the dagger to strike the hourglass…\\n\\nSuddenly with a great RATTLING NOISE the cage shoots upwards.  \\nNizam turns-- \\n\\nDASTAN\\nNo, this is your destiny!\\n\\n--and Dastan clobbers him with both feet, a human \\ncounterweight descending on the other end of the rope.  Nizam \\nis sent sprawling…   the dagger lands on the rocks, out of \\nboth of their reach.\\n\\n\\x0c126.\\n\\nNizam gets to his feet, scowling.  He draws both his swords.  \\nDastan draws his one.  They square off to duel.\\n\\nNizam’s two sword technique is unlike any fighting style \\nwe’ve seen.  He wields the swords with such skill and \\ndexterity that Dastan struggles to defend himself.\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nSoon you shall be nothing more than \\na dream that no one will remember!\\n\\nNizam presses the pace, attacking from both sides.   \\n\\nDastan makes a last desperate counter-attack and suddenly-- \\nKNOCKS one of Nizam’s swords from his hand!  \\n\\nA beat.  New ball game.\\n\\nNizam swings with his remaining sword-- Dastan blocks the \\nblow confidently.  With locked blades, Dastan presses for the \\nadvantage, his youth and strength coming into play…\\n\\nA look of fear crosses Nizam’s face.  Dastan grins.\\n\\nDASTAN \\n\\nNot so confident with only one \\nblade?\\n\\nBut then…\\xa0Dastan coughs.  Blood trickles from his mouth.  He \\nlooks down:\\n\\nNizam has drawn a hidden short sword with his other hand and \\nplunged it into Dastan’s side, mortally wounding him.   \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nI always keep a spare.\\n\\nNizam leaves Dastan bleeding on the ground and retrieves the \\ndagger.  Again he approaches the hourglass.\\n\\nAnd AGAIN, as he is poised to strike, the CAGE flies down and \\nTamina leaps out to stop him.  \\n\\nTAMINA\\n\\nDON’T!!\\n\\nBut this time Nizam is ready.  He sidesteps her attack, \\ndisarms her and grabs her by the throat.  He lifts her bodily \\nand holds her over the abyss…\\n\\n\\x0c127.\\n\\nNIZAM \\n\\n(looks at her)\\n\\nA very pretty face, indeed.  \\nPerhaps when you are born twenty \\nyears from now I will do you the \\nhonor of making you one of my \\nwives…\\n\\nDastan lifts his head and sees Nizam dangling Tamina.\\n\\nNIZAM (CONT'D)\\n…but right now you are a nuisance.\\n\\nAnd with that he releases her!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNo!!!\\n\\nDastan hears her screams echo into the distance as she falls.  \\nWith every last bit of his strength, he pulls himself up…\\n\\nNizam climbs the steps to the hourglass.  He takes out the \\ndagger and raises it high…\\n\\nHe strikes!  Just then…\\n\\nDASTAN lunges into frame, grabbing his hand to stop him.  Too \\nlate.  Nizam plunges the dagger into the glass:  not just the \\ntip, he buries the blade all the way up to the hilt!  \\n\\nTIME STOPS!\\n\\nFalling rocks and water frozen in midair, Dastan and Nizam \\ngrappling like two statues, faces contorted--\\n\\nIn the silence resounds a booming NOISE, like ice cracking.  \\nThe CRACK spreads across the surface of the hourglass from \\nthe place where the dagger penetrated it.  And--\\n\\nSAND starts to pour from the crack.\\n\\nTIME RUNS BACKWARD!  Rocks and water fly back upward-- the \\nREWIND ACCELERATING as the crack in the hourglass widens, the \\nglowing white SAND pouring out at an ever-faster rate--\\n\\nDASTAN and NIZAM\\n\\nTHE REWIND\\n\\nAre untouched in the eye of the storm, in the blinding LIGHT \\nof the hourglass.  Both of their hands are on the dagger.\\n\\n\\x0c128.\\n\\nBecomes a blur through which we catch quick glimpses of \\nprevious action:  Dastan fighting Garsiv, Tus’s murder on the \\nbridge, Tamina and Dastan kissing, etc.\\n\\nIN THE COURTYARD the shadow of the minaret races backwards \\naround the sun dial as night reverses to dawn.\\n\\nAll the while, SAND keeps pouring from the hourglass-- now in \\na torrent, swept by the wind into a blinding SANDSTORM that \\nthreatens to grow out of control…\\n\\nDASTAN, as if stunned by a concussion, shakes himself awake \\nto realize he’s there with Nizam, in the bright ROARING \\ncenter of the sandstorm.\\n\\nNizam, in ecstasy, holds the dagger in place -- SAND pouring \\nout of what is no longer the hourglass, but a CRACK in the \\nvery surface of the universe.   \\n\\nSavagely, Nizam pries Dastan’s hand from the dagger.  Dastan \\nhangs on, too weak to fight back.  The wind rips at him; if \\nhe lets go, he’ll be sucked into oblivion.\\n\\nNizam gives Dastan a sharp elbow.  Dastan is nearly swept off \\nby the wind-- but he keeps a hold.\\n\\nDastan looks down, sees blood soaking his tunic.  His life is \\nebbing away; he can’t hang on much longer.\\n\\nThen, out of the maelstrom of events REWINDING all around \\nthem, an IMPLOSION of light in the dawn sky attracts Dastan’s \\nattention.  Hazily looking up, he sees a flaming arrow arcing \\nbackward through the sky:  the opening battle.\\n\\nDastan summons the last of his strength and will.  Bearing \\ndown on Nizam’s arm, he PULLS OUT THE DAGGER.\\n\\nIn that instant, the crack in the hourglass repairs itself, \\nas it magically did when Dastan withdrew the dagger before.  \\nAt the same time, the SANDSTORM sweeps both Nizam and Dastan \\ninto the void…\\n\\nFor a few moments, SAND is all we see and hear.  Then, little \\nby little, the SANDSTORM starts to clear…\\n\\nDastan looks around.  At first he can’t tell where he is.  \\nThe sand is everywhere.  In his teeth, in his hair.  He \\nsearches himself for the dagger.  He doesn’t have it.\\n\\nGradually he starts to make out other figures nearby.  \\nPersian soldiers, shouting in the wind.  Horses whinny…\\n\\n\\x0c129.\\n\\nWith a shock of dread, Dastan realizes--\\n\\nEXT. BELOW THE CITADEL - SUNRISE\\n\\nWe’re reliving the opening battle.  The Persian army is \\nalready charging toward Alamut-- beginning the whole thing \\nover with the inexorability of a nightmare.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNo!  No!!\\n\\nEXT. RAMPARTS - SUNRISE\\n\\nLashed by sand and wind, the Alamut Sentry grabs a stick and \\nbeats the gong in warning as he did the first time.\\n\\nINT. TAMINA’S BEDROOM - SUNRISE\\n\\nThe GONG awakens Tamina.  Sand is blowing into the room.\\n\\nEXT. BELOW THE CITADEL - SUNRISE\\n\\nTus raises his sword and lets out a WAR CRY, exactly \\nrepeating his action of the opening sequence.  From the ranks \\nrises a blood-curdling noise as thousands of voices join him.\\n\\nOnly one thing has changed:  Dastan.  Outwardly he’s the \\nsame, but his faces shows a new maturity and resolve.  He \\nknows what he must do.\\n\\nDastan looks to the ramparts and sees the flaming arrow \\nlaunched into the air.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nHe rides toward Tus, shouting--\\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nTus!  Call off the attack!\\n\\nThe arrow explodes into a shower of brilliant fireworks, \\nilluminating the scene like a lightning flash.\\n\\nNizam, on horseback, suddenly blocks Dastan’s way.  He \\nstrikes, nearly knocking Dastan off his horse.\\n\\n\\x0c130.\\n\\nDastan tries to ride past but Nizam maneuvers to block him.  \\nTheir eyes meet: both held the dagger, both remember \\neverything. \\n\\nThey clash on horseback-- Dastan parries Nizam’s double-\\nbladed attack.  The duel begins…\\xa0while around them the Alamut \\narchers begin to pick off Persian soldiers, creating chaos as \\nbefore.\\n\\nTus, in the vanguard, looks around and sees--\\n\\nDastan and Nizam dueling.  His face contorts with anger.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nDastan.\\n\\nHe does not know why his hot-headed younger brother is \\nfighting with Nizam, but he knows Dastan’s immaturity is \\njeopardizing the battle.  Enraged, Tus rides back…\\n\\nNIZAM AND DASTAN,\\n\\nfight furiously.  As before, Dastan’s on the defensive.  A \\ngrowing circle of onlookers gathers, uncertain whether to \\nintervene. \\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\n(to the men)\\n\\nTraitor!  The King’s son would \\nbetray us to our enemy!\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nHe’s lying!\\n\\nThe battlefield around them is chaos-- soldiers felled by \\narrows, catapults erupting in FLAMES.\\n\\nNizam’s personal guards ride toward the dueling pair.  A \\nhandful of common footsoldiers block their way with spears.\\n\\nBRUTISH SOLDIER\\n\\nOh no.  This stays a fair fight.\\n\\nIn a bold and desperate move, Dastan stands up on his saddle \\nand launches himself at Nizam, knocking him off his horse.  \\nThey roll together on the ground.  Nizam lands on his back, \\nDastan straddling him, sword raised--\\n\\nTus arrives on horseback, forcing his way through the circle.\\n\\nTUS\\nHold!  HOLD!!\\n\\n\\x0c131.\\n\\nDastan freezes, inches from killing Nizam.  He can’t disobey \\nhis brother.\\n\\nNizam’s right hand creeps along the ground, toward his sword \\nthat landed inches away…\\n\\nTus, call off the attack!  It’s a \\ntrick.  Nizam lied to us.\\n\\nWe can win.  Dastan is a traitor.\\n\\nDastan, put down your sword.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNIZAM\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nWhat did you say?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nTus can’t believe Dastan’s insubordination.\\n\\nWe have no reason to attack Alamut.  \\nThis is all a part of his plan.\\n\\nMenacingly, Tus draws his own sword.\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nHe is your uncle and your elder.  \\nPut down your sword.\\n\\nThe threat is clear.  Still Dastan hesitates.\\n\\nNizam sees his chance.  His right hand closes on his sword \\nhilt; he swings upward at Dastan’s neck--\\n\\nDastan sees the sword coming, BLOCKS it--\\n\\nAs Nizam expected:  he pulls out the hidden short sword with \\nhis OTHER hand and strikes toward Dastan’s exposed torso--\\n\\nBut this time Dastan knows it’s coming:  with blinding speed \\nDastan turns, BLOCKS the second blow, and drives his sword \\nlike a stake into Nizam’s heart.\\n\\nThe men watching are stunned.  Nizam can’t believe it either.\\n\\nHe coughs.  And then he’s dead.\\n\\n\\x0cDastan hurls his sword away from him; it sticks quivering in \\nthe frozen ground.  He stands to face Tus.\\n\\n132.\\n\\nDastan advances, making it easier for Tus to kill him.\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\nKill me if you must.  But call off \\nthe attack, for Alamut is \\nblameless.  Examine closely the \\ndocuments Nizam showed us-- they \\nare fake.  \\n\\nDASTAN (CONT'D)\\nTus, do you remember Father’s words \\nto you on a the day we left for \\nwar?  ‘A king must listen always to \\nthe voice of reason.’\\n\\nTUS\\n\\n(mystified)\\n\\nHow could…?\\n\\nDASTAN\\n\\n‘…but also listen to your heart.’\\n\\nTus stares at him.  Dastan meets his gaze, calmly resolute.  \\nThis is not the younger brother he knew.  It’s as if Dastan’s \\nmatured overnight.\\n\\nTus turns and shouts--\\n\\nTUS\\n\\nHalt!  Retreat!\\n\\nHis orders echo through the ranks, repeated by the commanders \\nat every level.\\n\\nEXT. BATTLEMENT - SUNRISE\\n\\nAn Alamut PRIEST takes the dagger from an ornate box and is \\nabout to entrust it to the Fearsome armored Warrior when--\\n\\nAlamut soldiers come running bearing news, shouting.  The \\nPriest looks out over a parapet.\\n\\nBelow, the great wave of men moving toward the castle has \\nstopped.  The Persian army is turning around.\\n\\nThe Priest looks at the dagger in his hand… utters a silent \\nPRAYER of thanks, and replaces it in its box.\\n\\n\\x0c133.\\n\\nEXT. RAMPART - SUNRISE\\n\\nTamina, in her nightgown, watches through a loophole as the \\narmy vanishes into the mist.  On her young face is a vague \\nsense of the danger she’s just escaped.\\n\\nEXT. ALAMUT COURTYARD - [LATER THAT] DAY\\n\\nA Persian delegation, Tus, the twins, Dastan and forty \\nsoldiers, marches past Alamut soldiers standing at attention. \\n\\nThe King of Alamut and his court awaits them on a dais.  \\n\\nTUS\\n(bows formally)\\n\\nFrom my father, King Shahraman.\\n\\nAn ATTENDANT steps forward bearing a chest; an INTERPRETER \\nrepeats Tus’s words in Foreign.  The King responds in kind…\\n\\nAs the formalities drag on, Dastan slips away from his \\nbrothers.  As he edges over towards the temple, he tries to \\ncatch the eye of…\\n\\nTAMINA, resplendent in full regalia, standing amongst a group \\nof Alamut NOBLEWOMEN.  She notices the young Prince looking \\nat her…  he smiles!  She blushes and turns away, giggling \\nwith one of her LADIES-IN-WAITING.  But she glances back \\nanyway… \\n\\nOn the dais, Tus and the King of Alamut embrace in ritual \\nfriendship.  A murmur runs through the crowd.\\n\\nThe Twins lean together for a private aside.\\n\\nI hope he doesn’t make us marry his \\ndaughter.\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nFARHAN\\n\\nFARHAD\\n\\nMake you marry her.\\n\\nNo, you.\\n\\nThe sound of a SPLASH and a following commotion turns their \\nheads.  The Twins are greatly amused to see that:\\n\\n\\x0c134.\\n\\nDASTAN has fallen into the SACRED FOUNTAIN of ALAMUT. An \\nimpromptu baptism.  An irritated Alamut Priest helps fish him \\nout.\\n\\nTus shakes his head in embarrassment:  his younger brother, \\nat it again.  The King waves it off indulgently.\\n\\nDastan emerges, dripping wet, with a big grin on his face.  \\nHe looks right at--\\n\\nTAMINA, unable to suppress a smile of amusement and \\ncuriosity.  \\n\\nDastan gets a glimmer in his eyes.  He winks at her, as if \\nthe two of them share a secret…\\n\\nFADE OUT.\\n\\n\\x0c\""

Look up.\\n\\nFerris pulls the trigger.\\n\\nA MISSILE is launched from the Star Sapphire and flies \\ntowards Sinestro.\\n\\nON THE GROUND\\n\\nJordan sees the incoming Missile and dives for cover.\\n\\nSinestro turns around and instantly creates a BARRIER in \\nfront of the Missile, destroying it. \\n\\nHe then releases an ENERGY BEAM that rips the Ferris\\' \\naircraft apart.\\n\\nIN THE AIR\\n\\nFerris is thrown out of the cockpit.\\n\\nON THE GROUND\\n\\nJordan sees this -\\n\\n\\x0c109.\\n\\nJORDAN\\n\\nCarol!\\n\\nAs he is about to launch himself to her, Sinestro creates an \\nENERGY CONSTRUCT that grabs Jordan and tosses him in the \\nopposite direction.\\n\\nJordan recovers quickly. He punches the ground, burying the \\nRing in the soil. From Jordan\\'s fist, a NARROW STREAM OF \\nDISRUPTED DIRT races towards Sinestro. As it reach the \\nalien\\'s feet, a BEAM OF ENERGY erupts from the ground and \\npunches Sinestro squarely in the jaw, sending him reeling.\\n\\nJordan looks up to see Ferris plummeting to her death.\\n\\nJORDAN (CONT\\'D)\\n\\nNo!\\n\\nIn desperation, Jordan extends his hand as if to catch her. \\nWilled into existence by Jordan\\'s subconscience, a BEAM \\nemerges from his Ring, spanning the distance to Ferris in an \\ninstant.\\n\\nThe beam of energy transforms itself into a GIANT HAND, \\ncatching her and gently placing Ferris -\\n\\nIN THE AIR\\n\\nON THE GROUND\\n\\nJordan flies past Sinestro to finds Ferris unconscious but \\nalive.\\n\\nHe gazes at his Ring in recognition of its potential for the \\nfirst time. Remembering Kyle\\'s words -\\n\\nJORDAN\\n(to himself)\\n\\nThe ring can make things, if you \\nuse your imagination.\\n\\nSinestro appears behind him.\\n\\nSINESTRO\\n\\nYou have no inkling of the power \\nyou hold in your hands. Are you the \\nbest this world can offer? Why did \\nthat fool chose you to succeed him? \\nOr was it your people who selected \\nyou as their champion?\\n\\n\\x0c110.\\n\\nJORDAN\\n\\nYou want to know who chose me?\\n\\nJordan turns around, coldly raging. Sinestro’s amused sneer \\nvanishes.\\n\\nJORDAN (CONT\\'D)\\n\\nYou did. \\n\\nJordan launches himself at Sinestro, surprising the alien \\nwith the speed and ferocity of the attack.\\n\\nThe BATTLE continues –\\n\\nIN THE AIR\\n\\nInspired by Kyle’s drawing, Jordan’s ENERGY CONSTRUCTS are \\nsimplistic but effective.\\n\\nRecovering from Jordan’s assaults, Sinestro looks around for \\nJordan. Someone taps him on the shoulder. Sinestro turns \\naround to find Jordan behind him, with a GIGANTIC HAMMER in \\nhand. Sinestro is sent flying again.\\n\\nON THE GROUND\\n\\nRESCUE VEHICLE reach Ferris. Kalmaku, with the help of  \\nMEDICAL PERSONNEL, revives her.\\n\\nFERRIS\\n\\nWhere’s Hal?\\n\\nKalmaku points skyward at the battle overhead.\\n\\nKALMAKU\\n\\nOne thing for sure, you don\\'t mess \\nwith a guy\\'s girlfriend, no matter \\nwhat planet you\\'re from.\\n\\nIN THE AIR\\n\\nJordan continues his assault and Sinestro is fighting back.  \\nSinestro is sweating and showing signs of fatigue. And fear.\\n\\nThe alien finally grabs hold of Jordan in a VICE then creates \\na DRILL to penetrate Jordan’s shield. Jordan, in turn, \\ncreates a BOXING GLOVE that knocks Sinestro away.\\n\\nBoth men are exhausted but continue to fight. Their \\nrespective ENERGY CONSTRUCTS progressively become less \\nelaborate, weaker in strength and smaller in size.\\n\\n\\x0c111.\\n\\nSoon there are no more constructs. They are fighting with \\ntheir fists. Eventually, both parties are too weak to \\ncontinue the battle airborne. They end up -\\n\\nON THE GROUND\\n\\nSlowly, Jordan gains the advantage. He punches Sinestro, his \\nblow deflected by Sinestro’s shield.\\n\\nJORDAN\\n\\nYou come here!\\n\\nAnother punch is blocked.\\n\\nAnd another. Sinestro’s shield begins to weaken.\\n\\nJORDAN (CONT\\'D)\\n\\nThreaten my planet!\\n\\nJORDAN (CONT\\'D)\\nSeek to enslave my people!\\n\\nAnother. This time, the punch is only cushioned.\\n\\nJORDAN (CONT\\'D)\\n\\nTry to kill the woman I love!\\n\\nFinally, Sinestro’s shield shatters and Jordan’s fist meets \\nextraterrestrial flesh.\\n\\nJordan picks him up and holds him in place to receive a coup \\nde grace.\\n\\nJORDAN (CONT\\'D)\\n\\nNot while I’m around.\\n\\nAn unconscious Sinestro crumbles to the ground.\\n\\nJordan reaches down and removes Sinestro’s ring then crushes \\nit in his hands, leaving nothing but yellow dust that is \\ncarried away by the wind.\\n\\nJordan staggers. Just as he\\'s about to collapse, Ferris runs \\nup and braces him.\\n\\nYou okay?\\n\\nFERRIS\\n\\nJORDAN\\n\\nI haven\\'t felt this good in the \\nlast ten years.\\n\\nKalmaku drives up.\\n\\n\\x0c112.\\n\\nKALMAKU\\n\\nHal, someone’s asking for you.\\n\\nJordan picks up the radio.\\n\\nINT.

What does\\nthat have to do with what happened to me?\\nOkay. When I was in the legion,\\nthey gave me protocols for this.\\nIt can be difficult for Terrsies,\\nor people from underdeveloped worlds,\\nto hear that their planet is not the only\\ninhabited planet in the verse.\\nIt has to be the anesthesia.\\nI mean, it\\'s gotta be a dream.\\nProtocol actually says that most Terrsies\\nwill say that this has to be a dream.\\nYeah, because a dream is the only way\\nany of this makes sense.\\nCompared to what? The idea\\nthat you\\'re the only intelligent species,\\non the only inhabitable planet\\nin a universe so full of planets\\nthat you don\\'t even have a number\\nto describe how many there are?\\n- Are you saying you\\'re an alien?\\n- Genomgineered human.\\nThey cut my DNA with the DNA\\nof something like a wolf.\\nI\\'m a Lycantant,\\nbred for the military, but...\\nthat didn\\'t work out for me.\\n- And those things at the clinic?\\n- Keepers.\\nThey\\'re from the Diorite system,\\nbut they\\'re genetically repurposed\\nto act as monitors and watchdogs.\\nAnd they\\'re trying to kill me?\\n- Yes.\\n- Why me?\\nPlease.

Sorry, I gotta take this.\\nI\\'m guessing Titus\\ndidn\\'t say anything about it.\\nNo. Must have slipped his mind.\\nNot easy to picture you\\nmaking a deal with a royal.\\nTitus told me you were posted\\nto this planet\\nand said if I helped him, he\\'d get you\\nyour wings back, full reinstatement.\\n- I figured I owed you.\\n- Yeah, you do.\\nBut if she is a recurrence...\\nthen this is a hell of a lot more\\nimportant than wings.\\nIt\\'s life changing, Jupiter!\\nWait till you see this thing.\\nTwo million pixels of resolution.\\nEverything I ever wanted.\\nYeah, no.

love,<br/>cherish, honor, and protect?<br/><br/>I do.<br/><br/>To shield from<br/>terrors known and unknown?<br/><br/>- To lie, to deceive...<br/>- What?<br/><br/>To live a double life, to fail<br/>to prevent her abduction,<br/><br/>erase her identity,<br/>force her into hiding,<br/><br/>take away<br/>all she has known...<br/><br/>Stop.<br/><br/>...in a selfish, futile,<br/>fleeting attempt...<br/><br/>Stop.<br/><br/>...to escape<br/>your own true self?<br/><br/>Please, stop.<br/><br/>And, Julia, do you<br/>choose to accept?<br/><br/>Don\\'t.<br/><br/>- I do.<br/>- No.<br/><br/>You should have<br/>killed me, Ethan.<br/><br/>Fate whispers<br/>to the warrior...<br/><br/>A storm is coming.<br/><br/>And the<br/>warrior whispers back...<br/><br/>I am the storm.<br/><br/>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.<br/><br/>The anarchist Solomon Lane.<br/><br/>Since you captured him<br/>2 years ago,<br/><br/>his absence from the world stage<br/>has had unintended consequences.<br/><br/>His Syndicate of rogue covert operatives<br/>continues to wreak havoc around the globe.<br/><br/>The CIA\\'s<br/>Special Activities Division<br/><br/>has relentlessly hunted Lane\\'s<br/>elite network of hostiles.<br/><br/>But many remain unknown<br/>and at large.<br/><br/>The remnants of this<br/>extremist splinter cell<br/><br/>refer to themselves as<br/>\"The Apostles.\"<br/><br/>They have since adopted<br/>a policy of terror-for-hire,<br/><br/>making them<br/>an even greater threat.<br/><br/>They are responsible for<br/>the recent smallpox outbreak<br/><br/>in Indian-controlled Kashmir,<br/><br/>along the borders of China<br/>and Pakistan,<br/><br/>threatening one-third<br/>of the world\\'s population.<br/><br/>The epidemic<br/>is being contained,<br/><br/>but intelligence<br/>would indicate<br/><br/>that a new client has hired the Apostles<br/>for a more ambitious operation.<br/><br/>They have been contacted<br/>by this man,<br/><br/>an unidentified extremist known<br/>only by the code name John Lark,<br/><br/>author of this<br/>apocalyptic manifesto<br/><br/>calling for the destruction<br/>of the current world order.<br/><br/>It is believed Lark is responsible<br/>for the disappearance<br/><br/>of Norwegian nuclear weapons<br/>specialist Nils Delbruuk.<br/><br/>Dr. Delbruuk\\'s security<br/>clearance was revoked<br/><br/>after he expressed<br/>fiercely anti-religious views.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Apostles<br/>have been in contact<br/><br/>with elements of the Eastern<br/>European underworld,<br/><br/>who are in possession<br/>of three plutonium cores<br/><br/>stolen from a missile base<br/>in eastern Russia.<br/><br/>This would indicate that<br/>John Lark and the Apostles<br/><br/>are working together to acquire<br/>functioning nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>NEST estimates that a man<br/>with Delbruuk\\'s knowledge,<br/><br/>using the materials in play,<br/><br/>could complete three nuclear<br/>weapons in as little as 72 hours.<br/><br/>These devices would be<br/>man-portable<br/><br/>and deployable anywhere<br/>on Earth overnight.<br/><br/>In the hands of John Lark<br/>and the Apostles,<br/><br/>these weapons represent<br/>an unprecedented threat<br/><br/>to countless millions.<br/><br/>Your mission, should you<br/>choose to accept it,<br/><br/>is to prevent the Apostles<br/>from acquiring plutonium<br/><br/>using any means<br/>at your disposal.<br/><br/>If you or any members of your<br/>IMF team are caught or killed,<br/><br/>the Secretary will disavow<br/>any knowledge of your actions.<br/><br/>Good luck, Ethan.<br/><br/>This message will<br/>self-destruct in five seconds.<br/><br/>He\\'s late.<br/><br/>- He\\'s never late.<br/>- He\\'ll be here.<br/><br/>I don\\'t like it.<br/><br/>Something about this guy just<br/>really gives me the creeps.<br/><br/>Okay, just relax.<br/><br/>I\\'m relaxed.<br/><br/>You don\\'t sound relaxed.<br/><br/>Luther, does he sound<br/>relaxed to you?<br/><br/>He sounds terrified.<br/><br/>Please,<br/>I\\'m not terrified.<br/><br/>I just have<br/>a bad feeling is all.<br/><br/>I thought you said<br/>you were relaxed.<br/><br/>It\\'s entirely possible to be relaxed<br/>and extremely uneasy at the same time.<br/><br/>- No, it\\'s not.<br/>- You do it all the time.<br/><br/>- No, I don\\'t.<br/>- Yes, you do.<br/><br/>No, he doesn\\'t.<br/><br/>I\\'m supposed to believe that<br/>you are perfectly relaxed,<br/><br/>- right here, now...<br/>- Benji.<br/><br/>...in a dark alleyway, waiting to buy<br/>black-market plutonium from a psychopath.<br/><br/>Benji, I won\\'t let anything<br/>happen to you.<br/><br/>- Okay.<br/>- See, Benji,<br/><br/>you\\'re perfectly safe.<br/><br/>That\\'s easy for you to say,<br/>you\\'re in the van.<br/><br/>Well, you wanted to be<br/>in the field, tough guy.<br/><br/>And tonight, Luther, I would<br/>like to be in the van!<br/><br/>He\\'s here.<br/><br/>Oh, God.<br/><br/>Have that<br/>money ready, Luther.<br/><br/>Copy.<br/><br/>Ethan, do you copy?<br/><br/>Do you copy?<br/><br/>Are we finally gonna<br/>do this or not?<br/><br/>I have survived in this business<br/>with the help of a voice in my head.<br/><br/>This voice is never wrong.<br/>And whenever I meet you,<br/><br/>it tells me the same thing.<br/><br/>What\\'s that?<br/><br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>I\\'m here to do business. Tell<br/>the voice to flip a coin.<br/><br/>What\\'s that?<br/><br/>This is a beryllium rod,<br/>which is causing<br/><br/>a reaction with the plutonium<br/>inside the core.<br/><br/>That\\'s them.<br/><br/>The money?<br/><br/>The money.<br/><br/>Bring the money.<br/><br/>Luther, bring the money.<br/><br/>We\\'re gonna need<br/>that money, Luther.<br/><br/>Kill them.<br/><br/>I got it!<br/><br/>Luther, do you copy?<br/><br/>Luther!<br/><br/>Luther, come in.<br/><br/>Luther\\'s not here<br/>right now.<br/><br/>What can the Apostles<br/>do for you, Hunt?<br/><br/>- What do you want?<br/>- You\\'re boxed in, Hunt.<br/><br/>Give us the plutonium<br/>and walk away.<br/><br/>Benji, get the car.<br/><br/>- I don\\'t think I can do that.<br/>- Benji.<br/><br/>Get the car.<br/><br/>We\\'ll make you<br/>a deal, Hunt.<br/><br/>Give us the plutonium and<br/>we won\\'t kill your friend.<br/><br/>Don\\'t you do it, Ethan!<br/>Not for me!<br/><br/>I\\'m gonna<br/>count to three.<br/><br/>One.<br/><br/>- Two.<br/>- Luther...<br/><br/>- ...I\\'m sorry.<br/>- Three.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t know<br/>what else to do.<br/><br/>We\\'re good.<br/><br/>- You okay?<br/>- I should be dead.<br/><br/>We should all be dead.<br/><br/>Why aren\\'t we?<br/><br/>Where\\'s the plutonium?<br/><br/>It\\'s gone.<br/><br/>If you\\'re just joining us,<br/><br/>three massive explosions<br/>have gone off simultaneously<br/><br/>in what appears to be<br/>a coordinated attack.<br/><br/>This image is live in Rome,<br/>looking toward the Vatican<br/><br/>and is as close as<br/>our cameras can get.<br/><br/>It is believed that<br/>the Pope was in residence<br/><br/>at the time of the blast.<br/><br/>Also live, we\\'re looking at Jerusalem<br/>from just outside the city.<br/><br/>Also live,<br/>the holy city of Mecca<br/><br/>from the USS Ronald Reagan in the Red<br/>Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Radiation has been detected,<br/><br/>indicating that<br/>nuclear weapons were used<br/><br/>in these unspeakable attacks.<br/><br/>Ethan, it\\'s time.<br/><br/>No word on casualties yet,<br/>but we can assume<br/><br/>the death toll<br/>is catastrophic.<br/><br/>Early reports suggest<br/>the weapons used<br/><br/>would require<br/>highly specialized knowledge<br/><br/>that very few people possess.<br/><br/>The question now is who would attack all<br/>three of these holy sites? And why?<br/><br/>The attacks occurred<br/>at precisely the same moment,<br/><br/>just over an hour ago,<br/><br/>at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time.<br/><br/>Within minutes<br/>of the attack...<br/><br/>...Congress ordered<br/>an emergency recess<br/><br/>and the Capitol Building<br/>was evacuated.<br/><br/>The President left Washington<br/>on Air Force One.<br/><br/>The White House has declared<br/>a state of emergency,<br/><br/>placing the military<br/>on highest alert.<br/><br/>Would you excuse us, please?<br/><br/>Dr. Delbruuk.<br/><br/>We know who you are.<br/><br/>We read the manifesto,<br/>we found your lab.<br/><br/>\"There has never been peace<br/><br/>\"without first<br/>a great suffering.<br/><br/>\"The greater the suffering,<br/>the greater the peace.\"<br/><br/>See, this will<br/>unite them. Hmm?<br/><br/>When they read this manifesto,<br/>they\\'ll all understand.<br/><br/>Nobody\\'s gonna<br/>read that manifesto, ever.<br/><br/>I can promise you that.<br/><br/>What day is it?<br/><br/>How long have I been here?<br/><br/>What\\'s the last thing<br/>you remember?<br/><br/>I was driving.<br/><br/>Someone hit me.<br/><br/>That was two weeks ago.<br/><br/>- Two weeks?<br/>- Two weeks.<br/><br/>This is yours,<br/>isn\\'t it?<br/><br/>It\\'s how Lark<br/>communicated with you.<br/><br/>- Lark?<br/>- John Lark.<br/><br/>- We know all about him.<br/>- You know nothing.<br/><br/>There\\'s information in this<br/>phone that could lead us to him.<br/><br/>And you have<br/>the passcode.<br/><br/>You think<br/>Lark is the enemy, hmm?<br/><br/>But you,<br/><br/>well, whoever you are,<br/>you are the enemy.<br/><br/>You\\'re why<br/>the system survives.<br/><br/>- Why the suffering goes on.<br/>- Shut up!<br/><br/>We don\\'t care about you.<br/>We want Lark.<br/><br/>What if we make a deal?<br/><br/>No,<br/>there\\'s no deal, Luther.<br/><br/>Step outside.<br/><br/>Give me five minutes<br/>with this guy.<br/><br/>Ethan, I can\\'t let you do that.<br/>That\\'s not who we are.<br/><br/>Then maybe we need to<br/>reconsider that.<br/><br/>What if they read<br/>the manifesto on the air?<br/><br/>What? You can do that?<br/><br/>We can do it<br/>with a phone call.<br/><br/>Well, if he reads<br/>Lark\\'s manifesto...<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>I\\'ll give you the passcode.<br/><br/>Ethan! Ethan!<br/><br/>Think, Ethan.<br/><br/>Think of the greater good,<br/>please.<br/><br/>Yeah, you do that.<br/><br/>Hmm?<br/><br/>Sir.<br/><br/>No, he won\\'t cooperate.<br/><br/>Yes, sir.<br/>If we read the manifesto<br/><br/>on the air.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry, sir.<br/><br/>Trading<br/>and global markets plummeted.<br/><br/>Stand by.

What can you do?<br/><br/>So, where\\'s Lane?<br/><br/>Certainly not at the bottom<br/>of the Seine.<br/><br/>I have him. He\\'s safe.<br/><br/>Where do I meet<br/>the courier?<br/><br/>Let\\'s talk about the woman.<br/><br/>Woman?<br/><br/>She was with you<br/>at the Palais.<br/><br/>Zola saw her again today.<br/><br/>She tried to kill Lane.<br/><br/>She had the chance to<br/>kill you, but she didn\\'t.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>We have a past.<br/><br/>It\\'s complicated.<br/><br/>Well, I\\'ll make it<br/>more complicated for you.<br/><br/>My price just went up.<br/><br/>Someone killed<br/>four of my men today.<br/><br/>I\\'m assuming it was her.<br/><br/>I want her, Lark.<br/><br/>And you\\'re gonna<br/>bring her to me.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you don\\'t<br/>meet the courier<br/><br/>and the plutonium goes<br/>to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>I\\'d hate for her<br/>to come between us.<br/><br/>She\\'s yours.<br/><br/>At the meeting. Not before.<br/><br/>Go to London.<br/><br/>Instructions will follow.<br/><br/>I knew if I followed her,<br/>you\\'d show up eventually.<br/><br/>Are you okay?<br/><br/>Ilsa, I never<br/>wanted to hurt you.<br/><br/>I know<br/>you have your reasons.<br/><br/>I know.<br/><br/>You need to walk away.<br/><br/>I can\\'t do that.<br/><br/>You weren\\'t at the Palais<br/>to kill Lark.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>You were there<br/>to protect him.<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>And you killed him<br/>to protect me.<br/><br/>You wanted Lark<br/>to break Lane out.<br/><br/>No. You needed him<br/>to break Lane out.<br/><br/>Because you have to<br/>kill Lane.<br/><br/>Who\\'s making you<br/>do this?<br/><br/>MI6.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>After we captured him<br/>in London,<br/><br/>they tried to bring Lane home<br/>through diplomatic channels.<br/><br/>But too many countries<br/>want their pound of flesh.<br/><br/>A man like that,<br/>what he\\'s seen,<br/><br/>what he knows about<br/>British Intelligence,<br/><br/>they can\\'t have him talking<br/>to a foreign government ever.<br/><br/>That\\'s not what I\\'m asking.<br/><br/>Why did they send you?<br/><br/>This is how<br/>I prove my loyalty.<br/><br/>This is how I come home.<br/><br/>But you were out.<br/><br/>You were free.<br/><br/>We are never free.<br/><br/>I spent two years<br/>undercover with Lane.<br/><br/>To them, I\\'m as much<br/>of a threat as he is.<br/><br/>I kill him,<br/>or I never stop running.<br/><br/>Now tell me where he is.<br/><br/>I can\\'t help you.<br/><br/>I will get to him<br/>one way or another.<br/><br/>Please don\\'t make me<br/>go through you.<br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/>Are you here in London?<br/><br/>I am.<br/><br/>Are you ready<br/>to meet the courier?<br/><br/>Yes. Where do I go?<br/><br/>Where would you<br/>like to meet?<br/><br/>Mr. Secretary.<br/><br/>I prayed to God<br/>that it wasn\\'t true.<br/><br/>Well,<br/>in his defense, sir,<br/><br/>if Ethan hadn\\'t intervened,<br/><br/>a great many people<br/>would have been killed.<br/><br/>Yes, Dunn, I\\'m sure that<br/>the good people of Paris<br/><br/>and the nation of France as a whole<br/>will take that into account.<br/><br/>So what the hell happened?<br/><br/>...at which point, we were<br/>told to come to London<br/><br/>and await<br/>further instructions.<br/><br/>And what happens now?<br/><br/>Now,<br/><br/>we meet the Widow<br/>in 20 minutes.<br/><br/>She\\'ll take us<br/>to a courier<br/><br/>who\\'ll hand over our missing plutonium<br/>in exchange for Solomon Lane.<br/><br/>Or, in our scenario,<br/><br/>Benji.<br/><br/>Jesus.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry, what?<br/><br/>Luther and I are gonna<br/>take you to the courier.<br/><br/>Walker stays here<br/>and guards the real Lane.<br/><br/>Absolutely not.<br/><br/>Wait, wait.<br/>Why do I have to be Lane?<br/><br/>Benji.<br/><br/>Our mission, my mission,<br/>is to recover that plutonium,<br/><br/>and I will do so<br/>at any cost.<br/><br/>Even if I have to<br/>trade Lane.<br/><br/>The real Lane.<br/><br/>And I will never let him go.<br/><br/>When the Apostles realize<br/>that you\\'re playing games,<br/><br/>you\\'ll lose the plutonium.<br/>Again.<br/><br/>You let us worry<br/>about the Apostles.<br/><br/>As it stands,<br/>we have a bigger problem.<br/><br/>A bigger problem?<br/><br/>- Ilsa.<br/>- Ilsa?<br/><br/>Our Ilsa? Ilsa Faust Ilsa?<br/><br/>How is she mixed up<br/>in all of this?<br/><br/>She\\'s been ordered to kill Lane.<br/>Direct from MI6.<br/><br/>Look, wait. So that was her<br/>in Paris? On the bike.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>Ethan, she tried to kill us!<br/><br/>- No, not us. Not us.<br/>- Yeah.<br/><br/>Lane. She tried to kill Lane.<br/>She has no choice.<br/><br/>And she will kill me!<br/><br/>I\\'m not gonna<br/>let that happen.<br/><br/>Ethan, how exactly are you<br/>not gonna let that happen?<br/><br/>- I\\'m working on it.<br/>- Oh, he\\'s working on it.<br/><br/>Right now,<br/>we don\\'t have a lot of time.<br/><br/>We have to get ready<br/>for this meeting.<br/><br/>The meeting is a trap.<br/><br/>The White Widow<br/>is working with the CIA.<br/><br/>She has been<br/>since the beginning.<br/><br/>Bargaining for immunity<br/>is her stock-in-trade.<br/><br/>Capturing the plutonium, and<br/>the Apostles, and John Lark<br/><br/>buys her a lot of goodwill<br/>with the Americans.<br/><br/>But if Sloane knew<br/>the meeting was a trap,<br/><br/>why didn\\'t she just tell us?<br/><br/>Because, in her mind,<br/>anybody could be John Lark,<br/><br/>including one of us.<br/><br/>And now her suspicions<br/>are confirmed.<br/><br/>According to that dossier,<br/><br/>a trail of electronic evidence<br/>connects Hunt<br/><br/>to the theft of smallpox<br/>from the CDC.<br/><br/>It also links him<br/>to a lengthy correspondence<br/><br/>ending with the recruitment<br/>of Dr. Delbruuk.<br/><br/>And, of course, Hunt<br/>handed over the plutonium<br/><br/>to the Apostles himself.<br/><br/>Now, those facts,<br/>coupled with<br/><br/>a long and incriminating<br/>history of rogue behavior,<br/><br/>corroborate a CIA narrative<br/><br/>that Hunt has snapped.<br/><br/>And that his search for Lark<br/>is nothing but a cover<br/><br/>to hide the fact<br/>that Lark...<br/><br/>...is me.<br/><br/>I\\'ve got to<br/>hand it to you, Ethan.<br/><br/>Normally, when people refer to<br/>you as your own worst enemy,<br/><br/>it\\'s just a figure of speech.<br/><br/>I\\'m afraid Sloane\\'s got some<br/>questions for her as well.<br/><br/>The Widow offered her up<br/>at no extra charge.<br/><br/>And where did Sloane<br/>get this information?<br/><br/>She didn\\'t say.<br/><br/>She did, however, grant me the<br/>opportunity to bring you in,<br/><br/>on the condition that<br/>I terminate this mission<br/><br/>and hand over<br/>Solomon Lane personally.<br/><br/>- Sir, you can\\'t do that.<br/>- Hunt.<br/><br/>I know Lane. And he has<br/>no intention of going back.<br/><br/>That\\'s why<br/>we\\'re taking him back.<br/><br/>Which means that\\'s exactly<br/>what he wants us to do.<br/><br/>- Ethan...<br/>- Sir, what do you<br/><br/>think this is?<br/>A coincidence?<br/><br/>That someone just<br/>happened upon this?<br/><br/>Lane had it sent to her.<br/>He knew how she would react.<br/><br/>Just like he knew<br/>the Widow would turn us in.<br/><br/>Don\\'t you see?<br/><br/>This, sir...<br/><br/>This is the trap.<br/><br/>- We are being directed.<br/>- Hunt!<br/><br/>There are still two plutonium<br/>cores in the wind!<br/><br/>And you lost them!<br/><br/>In fairness, sir,<br/>we all lost them.<br/><br/>Respectfully, sir,<br/>you weren\\'t there.<br/><br/>So making excuses for him<br/>is your full-time job now?<br/><br/>Good God, Ethan, don\\'t make this<br/>any harder than it already is.<br/><br/>I can no longer protect you,<br/>don\\'t you understand that?<br/><br/>This is as close as you\\'re ever<br/>gonna get to that plutonium.<br/><br/>Sir, you don\\'t<br/>actually believe this.<br/><br/>I believe I\\'ve been given<br/>a choice to protect you<br/><br/>or the IMF, which is why<br/>I\\'m bringing you in.<br/><br/>And if I refuse?<br/><br/>What do you think<br/>he\\'s here for?<br/><br/>You think<br/>he\\'s some observer?<br/><br/>He\\'s an assassin!<br/><br/>Erika Sloane\\'s<br/>number-one plumber.<br/><br/>You go rogue, he\\'s<br/>authorized to hunt you down<br/><br/>and kill you.<br/><br/>It\\'s the job.<br/>No hard feelings.<br/><br/>Accept it, Ethan.<br/><br/>You\\'ve lost this one.<br/>What\\'s done is done.<br/><br/>No, sir. No.<br/><br/>I am not asking you. I<br/>am giving you a direct order.<br/><br/>This mission is terminated.<br/><br/>Now!<br/><br/>Stickell, he\\'s your friend.<br/><br/>Would you please talk<br/>some sense into...<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry, sir,<br/>but you left me no choice.<br/><br/>There\\'s 15 minutes<br/>before we meet the Widow.<br/><br/>You want the plutonium,<br/>we\\'re the only ones<br/><br/>who can get it for you.<br/>You in or out?<br/><br/>In.<br/><br/>- What are you doing?<br/>- Benji needs to get ready.<br/><br/>- No, Ethan...<br/>- There\\'s no time, Luther.<br/><br/>I need you to trust me.<br/><br/>You all right?<br/><br/>Yeah, I just<br/><br/>got a bad<br/>feeling about this one.<br/><br/>If you don\\'t hear from us...<br/><br/>I\\'ll do it my way.<br/><br/>Don\\'t take<br/>your eyes off him.<br/><br/>Enough games.<br/>I\\'m taking you out of here.<br/><br/>Where\\'s Hunt?<br/><br/>He\\'s gone to the meeting,<br/>with a copy of you.<br/><br/>Calm down.<br/><br/>Call the Apostles. Warn them.<br/><br/>I have no way<br/>of contacting them.<br/><br/>For their safety and mine.<br/><br/>What I do have<br/>is an extraction team with<br/><br/>satellite overwatch<br/>and a prearranged rendezvous.<br/><br/>They\\'ll know as soon as<br/>we leave the building.<br/><br/>No, I\\'m staying here.<br/><br/>I haven\\'t finished<br/>with Hunt yet.<br/><br/>Why did you have to make this<br/>so fucking complicated?<br/><br/>I don\\'t understand<br/>what you mean.<br/><br/>The deal was simple.<br/><br/>I help you frame Hunt,<br/>you give me the plutonium.<br/><br/>You\\'re wasting time.<br/><br/>\"There cannot be peace without<br/>first a great suffering.<br/><br/>\"The greater the suffering,<br/>the greater the peace.\"<br/><br/>When I wrote those words,<br/><br/>I wasn\\'t referring to your<br/>peace or Hunt\\'s suffering.<br/><br/>The old world order<br/>needs dismantling,<br/><br/>and we have the tools<br/>to dismantle it.<br/><br/>All you seem to care about<br/><br/>is that Hunt lives<br/>to take the blame.<br/><br/>That\\'s not anarchy.<br/><br/>That\\'s revenge.<br/><br/>Yes, it is.<br/><br/>And when I have<br/>what I want,<br/><br/>the Apostles will give you<br/>the plutonium.<br/><br/>Hunt\\'s the only friend<br/>you\\'ve got.<br/><br/>You\\'re only alive today<br/><br/>because he didn\\'t have<br/>the guts to kill you.<br/><br/>Sloane was right.<br/>The IMF is Halloween.<br/><br/>Nothing but grown men<br/>wearing...<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>It\\'s just the job.<br/>No hard feelings.<br/><br/>I\\'ve ruined your day,<br/>haven\\'t I?<br/><br/>Oh!<br/><br/>And you were doing so well<br/>up until then.<br/><br/>Now, I think<br/>this one\\'s loaded.<br/><br/>You want to find out?<br/><br/>- So, how\\'d I do?<br/>- I never had a doubt.<br/><br/>I\\'m beginning to see why you<br/>guys enjoy this so much.<br/><br/>Hats off, Mr. Secretary.<br/><br/>- The man\\'s a natural.<br/>- Welcome to the team, sir.<br/><br/>You\\'re making a mistake.<br/><br/>No, the mistake was mine when<br/>I saved your life over Paris.<br/><br/>This proves nothing.<br/>I\\'m playing a role,<br/><br/>just like you are, trying<br/>to recover that plutonium.<br/><br/>That doesn\\'t explain why<br/>you gave Sloane the dossier<br/><br/>and tried to frame Hunt.<br/><br/>He makes a good point,<br/><br/>Lark.<br/><br/>He\\'s paranoid. Delusional.<br/><br/>Just like the dossier says.<br/><br/>So where did Sloane<br/>get the dossier from?<br/><br/>I have no idea.<br/><br/>I do.<br/><br/>Did you get all that,<br/>Erika?<br/><br/>I did.<br/><br/>I don\\'t appreciate<br/>being used, Walker.<br/><br/>Oops. Bad boy.<br/><br/>Where would you<br/>like him delivered?<br/><br/>I\\'ll come to you.<br/><br/>Nobody move!<br/>Nobody move!<br/><br/>Weapons down! Drop \\'em!<br/><br/>Hands in the air!<br/>Weapons down!<br/><br/>Drop it! Drop it!<br/><br/>Weapons down!<br/>Right now! You!<br/><br/>It\\'s okay. It\\'s okay.<br/>It\\'s all right.<br/><br/>I thought we had a deal.<br/><br/>We did. And now we don\\'t.<br/><br/>There is too much at stake here<br/>for me to take any chances.<br/><br/>I\\'m bringing you all in,<br/>along with Walker.<br/><br/>The plutonium<br/>is still out there!<br/><br/>And I don\\'t trust a living<br/>soul in that room to get it.<br/><br/>We\\'ll sort out<br/>who\\'s who in Washington.<br/><br/>- Erika!<br/>- Sir?<br/><br/>It\\'s all right.<br/>Let\\'s just do what she says.<br/><br/>The only real threats are in<br/>this room, and we have them.<br/><br/>Do you?<br/><br/>Go.<br/><br/>Where the hell is Lane?<br/><br/>Ethan! Ethan!<br/><br/>First team is down.<br/>Send backup.<br/><br/>Sir!<br/><br/>Oh, no, no, no.<br/>Man down! Man down!<br/><br/>Somebody help!<br/><br/>Sir.<br/><br/>Ethan, I tagged Walker,<br/>but he\\'s on the run.<br/><br/>You got to get him.<br/><br/>Go.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry, sir.<br/><br/>Go.<br/><br/>Ethan?<br/><br/>Wait!<br/><br/>Get that son of a bitch.<br/><br/>Come on, come on, come on.<br/><br/>Yes! I got him.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry.<br/><br/>Talk to me, Benji.<br/>Where\\'s Walker?<br/><br/>He\\'s about a quarter<br/>mile west if you turn right.<br/><br/>To my right?<br/><br/>I can\\'t do that.<br/><br/>Why not?<br/><br/>Because I\\'m being followed.<br/><br/>What do you mean? By who?<br/><br/>How do I know?<br/>CIA, Apostles...<br/><br/>What difference does it make?<br/><br/>Okay, okay, just get<br/>out of there and then go right.<br/><br/>I am terribly sorry.<br/><br/>Excuse me.<br/><br/>Why is he running<br/>in circles?<br/><br/>Okay, you need to cross the street<br/>on your left as soon as you can.<br/><br/>Ethan, did you copy?<br/><br/>- Left, go left, now!<br/>- I\\'m working on it.<br/><br/>Now go across the street<br/>right in front of you.<br/><br/>Ethan, he\\'s getting away from you!<br/>You\\'re gonna have to go faster.<br/><br/>You\\'re gaining on him!<br/>Go straight.<br/><br/>Straight?<br/>Keep going straight?<br/><br/>Go straight, go straight,<br/>straight, straight.<br/><br/>Okay, now turn right.<br/><br/>Right?<br/><br/>Now?<br/><br/>- Yes, right!<br/>- Are you sure?<br/><br/>Yes, I\\'m...<br/><br/>No, it\\'s left! Turn left!<br/><br/>Sorry, I had<br/>the screen-lock on.<br/><br/>Left.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>- What are you waiting for?<br/>- I\\'m jumping out a window!<br/><br/>What do you mean,<br/>you\\'re jumping out of a...<br/><br/>Oh, sorry. I had it in 2D.<br/><br/>Good luck.<br/><br/>At the end of the bridge, turn left.<br/>You\\'ve almost got him.<br/><br/>Come on, come on, come on.<br/>Come on, Ethan, get him!<br/><br/>You\\'re right on top of him!<br/><br/>That\\'s it, he\\'s right<br/>in front of you!<br/><br/>Get him! Get him! Get him!<br/><br/>You can\\'t do it, can you? Not<br/>until you get your plutonium.<br/><br/>No. He still has<br/>plans for you.<br/><br/>You\\'re gonna turn yourself in<br/>and admit you\\'re John Lark,<br/><br/>then watch the old world implode<br/>from your dark little cell.<br/><br/>And if I don\\'t?<br/><br/>I\\'m her<br/>guardian angel, Hunt.<br/><br/>If I see you again,<br/>she dies.<br/><br/>If you try to warn her,<br/>she dies.<br/><br/>Know when you\\'re beat.<br/><br/>These are the designs we recovered<br/>from Dr. Delbruuk\\'s lab in Berlin.<br/><br/>That\\'s a five-megaton<br/>nuclear device.<br/><br/>That\\'s greater than<br/>all the explosive energy<br/><br/>released in World War II.<br/><br/>To disarm it, normally<br/>we\\'d cut the fuse wire here.<br/><br/>What, \"normally\"?<br/><br/>Walker and Lane<br/>have two plutonium cores,<br/><br/>meaning two bombs.<br/><br/>Yeah. And they\\'re both linked<br/>by a microwave fail-safe<br/><br/>which is accurate to<br/>within one-tenth of a second.<br/><br/>Any attempt to defuse one bomb<br/>automatically triggers the other.<br/><br/>Meaning once armed,<br/>the bombs cannot be disarmed.<br/><br/>The countdown is started<br/>by a remote detonator,<br/><br/>which is also a fail-safe.<br/><br/>Meaning once<br/>the countdown starts,<br/><br/>it can\\'t be stopped.<br/><br/>So the solution<br/>to this is?<br/><br/>We\\'re working on it.<br/><br/>So,<br/><br/>technically, this is<br/>a suicide mission.<br/><br/>What is it?<br/><br/>Have a seat. Please.<br/><br/>In all the years<br/>that I\\'ve known Ethan,<br/><br/>he\\'s only been serious<br/>about two women.<br/><br/>One was his wife.<br/><br/>He\\'s married?<br/><br/>No, he was.<br/><br/>Was?<br/>What happened to her?<br/><br/>Well, she was taken<br/><br/>by some people<br/>who wanted to get to Ethan.<br/><br/>It\\'s okay,<br/>he got her back in one piece.<br/><br/>Then he quit the game.<br/><br/>They were happy<br/>for a while.<br/><br/>But every time something<br/>bad happened in the world,<br/><br/>Ethan would think,<br/>\"I should\\'ve been there.\"<br/><br/>And she would wonder,<br/>\"Who\\'s watching the world<br/><br/>\"while Ethan\\'s<br/>watching me?\"<br/><br/>Deep down, they both knew<br/>that someday, somehow,<br/><br/>something truly terrible<br/>was going to happen<br/><br/>all because<br/>they were together.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>- Where is she now?<br/>- She\\'s a ghost.<br/><br/>Good at it, too.<br/><br/>Taught her myself.<br/><br/>Every now and then,<br/>she sends up a signal<br/><br/>to let Ethan know she\\'s safe.<br/><br/>And that keeps him going.<br/><br/>Why are you<br/>telling me this?<br/><br/>Hmm.<br/><br/>We\\'re in this mess because<br/>Ethan wouldn\\'t let me die.<br/><br/>He\\'s a good man.<br/><br/>And he cares about you<br/>more than he can admit.<br/><br/>That\\'s one more worry<br/>than he can handle right now.<br/><br/>If you care about him,<br/><br/>you should walk away.<br/><br/>Luther...<br/><br/>Is everything all right?<br/><br/>I\\'m coming with you.<br/><br/>I know.<br/><br/>So how do we find him?<br/><br/>Microwave transponder.<br/><br/>Traceable via satellite<br/>anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>Lane had one of these<br/>in the back of his neck.<br/><br/>We removed it in Paris.<br/><br/>At the same time, we put<br/>our own transponder in.<br/><br/>Got it.<br/><br/>36-hour<br/>delayed activation,<br/><br/>in case Lane\\'s Apostles<br/>scan him.<br/><br/>So you planned<br/>on letting him go.<br/><br/>Not this way, but yes.<br/><br/>He\\'s gonna lead us<br/>to the plutonium.<br/><br/>How can you be sure?<br/><br/>His plan to put me in<br/>prison went to hell.<br/><br/>Now he\\'s gonna want<br/>me there for the end.<br/><br/>So when does<br/>this transponder activate?<br/><br/>I got him. I got him,<br/>I got him, I got him!<br/><br/>He\\'s traveling east<br/>over Europe at 500 knots.<br/><br/>He\\'s airborne.<br/><br/>Shall we inform the CIA?<br/><br/>The CIA\\'s been infiltrated.<br/><br/>I don\\'t trust anybody<br/>outside of this room.<br/><br/>We\\'re gonna<br/>have to go it alone.<br/><br/>So where do we go?<br/><br/>How we doing, Benji?<br/><br/>If there\\'s a way to defuse<br/>these bombs, I can\\'t find it.<br/><br/>You\\'ll figure it out.<br/>I know you will.<br/><br/>Damn. Ethan,<br/>we lost the signal.<br/><br/>Lane must\\'ve<br/>found our transmitter.<br/><br/>- What\\'s his last position?<br/>- About 30 miles northeast.<br/><br/>Then that\\'s where<br/>he wants us to go.<br/><br/>- What\\'s there?<br/>- The Nubra River Valley.<br/><br/>There\\'s only<br/>a medical camp there.<br/><br/>Humanitarian Aid Overseas.<br/><br/>Why would Lane<br/>target a medical camp?<br/><br/>Smallpox.<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Smallpox. The Apostles triggered<br/>a smallpox outbreak in Kashmir.<br/><br/>Lane must\\'ve wanted that camp<br/>there for a reason.<br/><br/>But what?<br/><br/>- Oh, my God.<br/>- What is it?<br/><br/>The Nubra River is at the<br/>base of the Siachen Glacier.<br/><br/>So a nuclear blast there<br/>would irradiate<br/><br/>the largest natural irrigation<br/>system in the world.<br/><br/>Fresh water from the border of<br/>China to India and Pakistan.<br/><br/>They\\'re gonna starve one-third<br/>of the world\\'s population.<br/><br/>\"The greater the suffering...\"<br/><br/>\"...the greater the peace.\"<br/><br/>I still don\\'t understand why<br/>Lane wants a medical camp there.<br/><br/>It doesn\\'t matter.<br/><br/>All that matters now is we find<br/>a way to defuse those bombs.<br/><br/>Uh, I think I\\'ve found it.<br/><br/>Maybe. Um...<br/><br/>Look, there appears to be a flaw<br/>in the bomb\\'s operating system.<br/><br/>The remote detonator<br/>requires that firing key.<br/><br/>If we remove that key,<br/>then it should short out<br/><br/>the fail-safe and allow us<br/>to cut both fuses.<br/><br/>So one of us<br/>needs to get the detonator<br/><br/>and remove that key.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>While the rest of us cut the<br/>fuses on both bombs. Simple.<br/><br/>Yeah, but...<br/><br/>But what?<br/><br/>Well, in order<br/>to make this work,<br/><br/>we can\\'t remove the key<br/>or cut the fuses<br/><br/>until after<br/>the countdown starts.<br/><br/>But wait, just so<br/>I\\'ve got this clear.<br/><br/>Our only chance<br/>to safely defuse both bombs<br/><br/>is to let<br/>the countdown start.<br/><br/>And then remove that key.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Both devices are now<br/>connected to the detonator.<br/><br/>Fifteen minutes should<br/>give you enough time<br/><br/>to reach<br/>minimum safe distance.<br/><br/>My running days are over.<br/><br/>This is where it ends for me.<br/><br/>I\\'m getting signals<br/>all over the place.<br/><br/>We\\'re at a medical camp. X-ray<br/>machines, CAT scanners,<br/><br/>radiological signatures<br/>everywhere.<br/><br/>It\\'s like<br/>a needle in a haystack.<br/><br/>Process of elimination,<br/>one at a time.<br/><br/>Let\\'s split up.<br/>Stay on comms.<br/><br/>Ethan?<br/><br/>Julia?<br/><br/>Is that...<br/><br/>Julia!<br/><br/>Does he know?<br/><br/>Hey.<br/><br/>Uh, this is my husband, Erik.<br/><br/>Uh, this is...<br/><br/>Rob. Rob Thorne.<br/>Dr. Rob Thorne.<br/><br/>- I worked with Julia...<br/>- At Mass General.<br/><br/>Before New York.<br/><br/>Oh, you\\'re kidding.<br/><br/>- What a coincidence!<br/>- I know. I...<br/><br/>- What brings you all this way?<br/>- I was, uh...<br/><br/>I was in Turtuk,<br/>not far from here<br/><br/>and heard help was needed.<br/><br/>Oh, well,<br/><br/>actually we\\'re just about<br/>finished here.<br/><br/>The whole village<br/>is inoculated. But, um...<br/><br/>What were you doing<br/>out in Turtuk?<br/><br/>Rob\\'s on vacation.<br/><br/>No. No, I\\'m...<br/>I\\'m working.<br/><br/>You\\'re a long way from home.<br/><br/>Yeah, yeah. Thanks to<br/>our guardian angel.<br/><br/>Guardian?<br/><br/>Well, yeah. We were<br/>running a field hospital<br/><br/>outside of Darfur when<br/>the outbreak happened here.<br/><br/>And here comes<br/>this phone call<br/><br/>from an anonymous donor,<br/>out of the blue.<br/><br/>And he says<br/>he\\'s ready to underwrite<br/><br/>the entire operation.<br/>One condition.<br/><br/>We run the whole thing.<br/><br/>Can you believe that?<br/><br/>I certainly can.<br/><br/>Yeah. Out of the blue.<br/><br/>Out of the blue.<br/><br/>That\\'s quite a full life.<br/><br/>Yeah, you know, before<br/>Julia, I never traveled.<br/><br/>I never even left New York.<br/><br/>Never left the hospital.<br/><br/>Seven days a week,<br/>dusk till dawn. No vacations.<br/><br/>Ethan, I think<br/>I found something.<br/><br/>I was on the fast track<br/>to be Chief of Surgery at 50.<br/><br/>Heart attack at 55.<br/><br/>And she convinced me<br/>to let it all go.<br/><br/>Help where<br/>it\\'s needed most.<br/><br/>So we\\'ve been<br/>on the go ever since,<br/><br/>and I\\'ve never been<br/>more fulfilled.<br/><br/>I\\'m happy for you.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>- Well, we should get going.<br/>- Oh.<br/><br/>We have a lot of<br/>packing to do.<br/><br/>Oh, no, I\\'ll handle that.<br/>You two should catch up.<br/><br/>Oh, no, I should<br/>get out of your hair.<br/><br/>Are you kidding?<br/>You should stick around.<br/><br/>I\\'m just sorry you came<br/>all this way for nothing.<br/><br/>Um...<br/><br/>Tell you what,<br/>we\\'ll pack,<br/><br/>and why don\\'t we give you<br/>a ride back to Turtuk,<br/><br/>you two can catch up<br/>in the car? Yeah?<br/><br/>You\\'re very kind.<br/><br/>Settled.

I got this.<br/><br/>Don\\'t worry about old Luther.<br/><br/>Walker.<br/><br/>Damn.<br/><br/>Ethan, the countdown<br/>has started!<br/><br/>We have 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Walker has the detonator.<br/><br/>Come on, come on!<br/><br/>We have to evacuate<br/>these people.<br/><br/>There\\'s no time.<br/><br/>This whole valley\\'s gonna be<br/>incinerated in 15 minutes.<br/><br/>It\\'s too late!<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>I\\'m gonna get the detonator.<br/><br/>- What? How?<br/>- I\\'ll figure it out.<br/><br/>Find Lane!<br/>Find the other bomb!<br/><br/>- What the hell is he doing?<br/>- I find it best not to look.<br/><br/>How we doing, Luther?<br/><br/>Tripwires everywhere.<br/>I don\\'t have enough hands.<br/><br/>Just make it happen.<br/><br/>Where\\'s Ethan?<br/><br/>He\\'s gone after<br/>the detonator.<br/><br/>Wait, where\\'s the detonator?<br/><br/>Luther.<br/><br/>Julia.<br/>You shouldn\\'t be here.<br/><br/>Oh, my God.<br/><br/>Oh, my God.<br/><br/>Is that what I think it is?<br/><br/>Luther,<br/>get her out of there!<br/><br/>Where is she gonna go?<br/><br/>What can I do?<br/><br/>In the kit, the pliers<br/>with the red grip.<br/><br/>- Are you insane?<br/>- Mind your business, Benji.<br/><br/>This is my business!<br/><br/>Benji, do you copy?<br/><br/>Ethan!

Hey, hey...<br/>Did you find the other bomb?<br/><br/>We\\'re still looking,<br/>but finding the bomb<br/><br/>is not gonna matter<br/>unless we have the detonator.<br/><br/>I know. I know.<br/>I\\'ll get it. I\\'ll get it!<br/><br/>Uh, if he\\'s in<br/>another helicopter,<br/><br/>- how are you gonna get it?<br/>- I\\'ll figure it out.<br/><br/>You find the bomb,<br/>I\\'ll get the detonator.<br/><br/>I won\\'t let you down.<br/><br/>I won\\'t let you down.<br/><br/>- Be ready.<br/>- Look, Ethan. Ethan!<br/><br/>Ethan, come in!<br/><br/>Benji? Benji?

I know Lane.<br/>If we\\'re looking here,<br/><br/>it\\'s because he wants us to.<br/><br/>I\\'m heading to the village.<br/><br/>Just wait for me,<br/>all right?<br/><br/>Uh...<br/><br/>Ilsa, I think<br/>I\\'ve found something.<br/><br/>Cut this wire right here.<br/><br/>Turn that screw<br/>counterclockwise, very slowly.<br/><br/>Got it.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>How is he?<br/><br/>Oh, you know.<br/>Same old Ethan.<br/><br/>Jesus!<br/><br/>Oh, shit!<br/><br/>No, no, no, no, no, no.<br/><br/>- Benji, I see Lane.<br/>- What?

Turn the screw<br/>counterclockwise.<br/><br/>Yep.<br/><br/>Remove that panel<br/>and you\\'ll see<br/><br/>the power and ground wires<br/>for the fuse.<br/><br/>Got it.<br/><br/>When the time comes,<br/>cut the green wire.<br/><br/>Do not cut it yet.<br/><br/>Okay. We copy.<br/><br/>Ethan, if you can hear me,<br/>we\\'re ready to make the cut.<br/><br/>Ethan, come in.<br/><br/>Benji, how do we know<br/>if he\\'s got the key?<br/><br/>He\\'ll get it.<br/><br/>- Yeah, but how do we know?<br/>- He\\'ll get it done!<br/><br/>We\\'re out of time. We just<br/>have to hope he has it.<br/><br/>- Okay, we\\'re ready.<br/>- At two seconds we cut.<br/><br/>Wait, wait, wait!

That\\'s how many people<br/>have actually attempted<br/><br/>a rescue below 10,000 meters.<br/><br/>And the number one.<br/><br/>That\\'s how many are left alive<br/>to talk about it.<br/><br/>One man. Jonas Taylor.<br/><br/>And look what happened<br/>to that one man<br/><br/>the last time he went<br/>to these depths.<br/><br/>He saved eleven people,<br/><br/>including you, Heller.<br/>That\\'s what happened.<br/><br/>He left our friends to die,<br/><br/>because he had<br/>pressure-induced psychosis.<br/><br/>Come on, Heller.<br/>That was your diagnosis.<br/><br/>Jonas said<br/>something attacked them.<br/><br/>Something big enough to<br/>take out a nuclear submarine.<br/><br/>He\\'s a drunk.<br/><br/>You\\'re not listening!<br/>You\\'re not listening!<br/><br/>He washed up on a beach<br/>in Thailand.<br/><br/>- Did you hear what Lori said?<br/>- I\\'m listening. I heard it.<br/><br/>- Were you there?<br/>- That\\'s enough.<br/><br/>We all heard<br/>Lori\\'s last transmission.<br/><br/>We have to consider<br/><br/>that Origin may have<br/>encountered<br/><br/>something similar to what<br/>Jonas Taylor described.<br/><br/>Something he was able<br/>to escape from.<br/><br/>Ba! Please.<br/><br/>Prep the helicopter.<br/><br/>We must go to Thailand.<br/><br/>Your boat,<br/><br/>she\\'s killing me.<br/><br/>Number one engine<br/>slips out of the gear,<br/><br/>and there\\'s some leak<br/>in the hydraulics.<br/><br/>Hey, I\\'ll take a look<br/>at it tonight.<br/><br/>That\\'s what you said<br/>last night<br/><br/>and the night before that,<br/><br/>and the night before that.<br/><br/>Hey, I\\'m working up to it.<br/><br/>You drink too much.<br/><br/>Hey, now<br/>you\\'re only saying that<br/><br/>because I literally have<br/>a beer in my hand.<br/><br/>You always have beer<br/>in your hand.<br/><br/>You know why?<br/><br/>Because I drink too much?<br/><br/>Now this is shaping up to be<br/>an eventful Tuesday evening.<br/><br/>You know<br/>I like to make an entrance.<br/><br/>Hell, Mac, after five years,<br/><br/>just showing up<br/>is making an entrance.<br/><br/>What? You\\'re living<br/>above a bar? Really?<br/><br/>Figured it was the only way<br/>to get you to come visit.<br/><br/>Jonas,<br/>allow me to introduce...<br/><br/>It\\'s an honor to meet you,<br/>Doctor Zhang.<br/><br/>Always had a tremendous<br/>respect for your work.<br/><br/>You\\'re too kind, Mr. Taylor.<br/><br/>Yeah, no, I\\'m not.<br/>You\\'re a good man.<br/><br/>Hey, can I offer<br/>either of you two a beer?<br/><br/>\\'Cause I\\'m gonna have a beer.<br/><br/>It\\'s not a social call, Jonas.<br/><br/>You mean you didn\\'t helicopter<br/>in just to say \"hi\"?<br/><br/>You wound me, Mac.<br/><br/>- We have a serious...<br/>- Problem?<br/><br/>Thought so.<br/><br/>Just like you know<br/><br/>I don\\'t dive anymore.<br/><br/>Done being responsible<br/>for people, Mac.<br/><br/>Mr. Taylor...<br/><br/>Hey, I mean no offense,<br/>Doctor Zhang.<br/><br/>I mean, if there was<br/>two people on this planet<br/><br/>that could get me<br/>back into the water,<br/><br/>it\\'s probably you two.<br/><br/>But you can\\'t.<br/><br/>You\\'re gonna tell me your<br/>problem, and I\\'ll say no.<br/><br/>You\\'re gonna offer me money.<br/><br/>I\\'ll still say no.<br/><br/>You\\'re gonna appeal<br/>to my better nature,<br/><br/>and I\\'m gonna say no.<br/><br/>Because I don\\'t have one.<br/><br/>So I say,<br/>why don\\'t we sit down?<br/><br/>We\\'ll enjoy a couple of beers,<br/><br/>and then we can<br/>get you on your way.<br/><br/>Jonas.<br/><br/>This happened this morning.<br/><br/>Let\\'s get out<br/>of here. Blow the tanks!<br/><br/>I\\'m trying.<br/>It\\'s not working!<br/><br/>It\\'s not starting!<br/>Whole system\\'s down!<br/><br/>Mac, help!<br/>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br/><br/>DJ, Mac.<br/>There\\'s something down here.<br/><br/>Jonas was right.<br/><br/>Jonas was right!<br/>Do you co...<br/><br/>It\\'s Lori.<br/><br/>Your ex-wife<br/>and her crew are trapped<br/><br/>below 11,000 meters.<br/><br/>I fear they may<br/>have encountered<br/><br/>the same species<br/>you did down there.<br/><br/>I have divers with less<br/>experience willing to go.<br/><br/>But I feel<br/>I owe it to my crew<br/><br/>to give this rescue<br/>the best chance of success.<br/><br/>Please.<br/><br/>Lori,<br/>hand me that hexa key.<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Oh.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Okay, if we can<br/>short out the firewall,<br/><br/>I can... I can probably<br/>reboot the computers.<br/><br/>Okay. Try it now.<br/><br/>Auxiliary power\\'s back.<br/><br/>Heaters are online.<br/><br/>There\\'s no way that we\\'ll<br/>get the engine started,<br/><br/>but we might be able<br/>to get the ballast tanks back.<br/><br/>What are you doing?<br/>Taking notes?<br/><br/>Letter to my wife.<br/><br/>Just in case.<br/><br/>Hey.<br/><br/>We got this.<br/><br/>Step by step.<br/><br/>Come on. Give me<br/>that fighting octopus.<br/><br/>See?<br/><br/>Works every time.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>- What?<br/>- We gotta can the lights.<br/><br/>Turn out the lights.<br/><br/>There was<br/>something down there with us.<br/><br/>How can you be<br/>sure if there were<br/><br/>no observation windows<br/>on your craft?<br/><br/>\\'Cause whatever it was<br/><br/>caved in the entire starboard<br/>side of a nuclear submarine.<br/><br/>That wasn\\'t my imagination.<br/><br/>Is that why<br/>you blew the hatch mid-rescue?<br/><br/>Hey, look, I brought 11 men<br/>back safe and sound.<br/><br/>You left<br/>eight more to die<br/><br/>because you panicked.<br/><br/>If I hadn\\'t blown the hatch,<br/><br/>we all would have been<br/>killed by that thing.<br/><br/>There was no thing.<br/><br/>There was no evidence<br/>of anything.<br/><br/>Because<br/>it was destroyed<br/><br/>in the explosion, Heller.<br/><br/>Look, there was no time left!<br/>So I made the call!<br/><br/>And you left<br/>our friends there to die<br/><br/>in an act of cowardice!<br/><br/>What do you think<br/>happened down there?<br/><br/>He lost it.<br/><br/>And now we\\'re<br/>about to send him<br/><br/>into the exact same situation.<br/><br/>Excuse me, Suyin.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry to interrupt you,<br/>but we need you.<br/><br/>It\\'s an emergency.<br/><br/>What\\'s wrong, Jaxx?<br/><br/>Now they\\'re leaking oxygen.<br/><br/>They\\'ve got a couple of hours.<br/>Maybe more.<br/><br/>- I\\'m going.<br/>- No.<br/><br/>Wait, what?<br/><br/>I\\'ll take one of the gliders,<br/>grab the Origin,<br/><br/>- and tow her up.<br/>- Wait!<br/><br/>If the Origin\\'s ballast tanks<br/>blow, you\\'re gonna die, too.<br/><br/>We have to try.<br/><br/>Mummy?<br/><br/>Meiying.<br/><br/>Um...<br/><br/>Uh...<br/><br/>Communications check!<br/><br/>Good to go.<br/><br/>Suyin, you are go for launch.<br/><br/>Richard Byrd.<br/><br/>Auto descent<br/>sequence initiated.<br/><br/>- Hey, Meiying.<br/>- Hi.<br/><br/>- Sir, we\\'ve got a new problem.<br/>- It\\'s your daughter.<br/><br/>She took a glider<br/>to try and save them.<br/><br/>Why did you let her go?<br/><br/>Trust me,<br/>I didn\\'t let her do anything.<br/><br/>I was sort of<br/>under the impression<br/><br/>you\\'re supposed to try<br/>to save people<br/><br/>who are dying<br/>on the bottom of the ocean.<br/><br/>Who\\'s he?<br/><br/>I\\'m the guy<br/>who paid for all this.<br/><br/>Uh-huh.<br/><br/>You know, he looks heroic<br/>and he walks fast,<br/><br/>but he\\'s kind of<br/>got a negative attitude.<br/><br/>What\\'s the window?<br/><br/>It\\'ll be close.<br/><br/>Who are you?<br/><br/>I\\'m the one<br/>that designed all this.<br/><br/>So my life\\'s in your hands?<br/><br/>Pretty much. That a problem?<br/><br/>Nah.<br/><br/>You look like you might<br/><br/>actually know<br/>what you\\'re doing.<br/><br/>Dive control level.<br/><br/>Oh, I\\'m sorry.<br/><br/>Mac, have Doctor Heller<br/>meet us in the medical bay.<br/><br/>Heller?<br/><br/>Did I not mention that?<br/><br/>You mother...<br/><br/>He\\'s in perfect shape.<br/><br/>Just like the last time<br/>you examined me.<br/><br/>Suyin took a glider<br/>15 minutes ago.<br/><br/>She\\'s planning<br/>on taking the Origin back up.<br/><br/>Take me to the sub.<br/><br/>- We\\'re not done here.<br/>- Yeah, we are.<br/><br/>Lori\\'s running out of air,<br/><br/>and we\\'re in<br/>international waters,<br/><br/>which means legally<br/><br/>I can beat the ever-loving<br/>shit out of you<br/><br/>and get away with it.<br/><br/>It\\'s true.<br/><br/>Legally, I mean.<br/><br/>Good thing<br/>he doesn\\'t hold a grudge.<br/><br/>Jonas, you do know<br/><br/>that this sub is rated<br/>for 12,000 meters, right?<br/><br/>Like the one leaking<br/>on the ocean floor?<br/><br/>Ah. Good point.<br/><br/>- We good?<br/>- Yep.<br/><br/>Once you strip back<br/>the safeties<br/><br/>and go full manual,<br/>like I know you\\'re gonna do,<br/><br/>the system\\'s gonna<br/>have problems<br/><br/>trying to keep up<br/>with your pressure changes.<br/><br/>Try not to blow<br/>your ears out, brother.<br/><br/>Thanks, mate.<br/><br/>Hello, skipper.<br/><br/>You must be the crazy guy.<br/><br/>Now who called me that?<br/><br/>My mom. Doctor Heller.<br/><br/>Yeah, well, I\\'m not crazy.<br/><br/>I\\'ve just seen things<br/>no one else has.<br/><br/>That\\'s the definition<br/>of crazy.<br/><br/>Backup power. Backup power...<br/><br/>So where are your parents?<br/><br/>My mom\\'s trying<br/>to bring our friends back<br/><br/>from the bottom of the ocean.<br/><br/>My dad\\'s with a Pilates<br/>instructor in Taipei.<br/><br/>Granddad says<br/>Mom needs to move on,<br/><br/>but Mom says<br/>she needs some more time<br/><br/>because she was<br/>married to an a-hole.<br/><br/>Sounds like<br/>your mom\\'s got a point.<br/><br/>You know a lot.<br/><br/>Eight-year-olds<br/>hear everything.<br/><br/>Mind if I give it a try?<br/><br/>Bye.<br/><br/>Hey, Crazy.<br/><br/>Is my mom gonna die?<br/><br/>I\\'ll have Captain Bubbles<br/>and your mom back in no time.<br/><br/>I promise.<br/><br/>Thank you, Emma.<br/><br/>Evolution<br/>launch in T-minus 15 seconds.<br/><br/>- DJ?<br/>- Yeah.<br/><br/>Jaxx, we good?<br/><br/>Doc?<br/><br/>Evolution,<br/><br/>we are go for dive.<br/><br/>Fancy.<br/><br/>System go for descent.<br/><br/>System go for descent.<br/><br/>Hey, brother.<br/>We\\'re good to go.<br/><br/>System go for descent.<br/><br/>System go for descent.<br/><br/>Jonas.<br/><br/>System go for descent.<br/><br/>Evolution successful launch.<br/><br/>Evolution now passing<br/>1,000 meters.<br/><br/>Caution. Evolution<br/>secondary systems offline.<br/><br/>How is he descending so fast?<br/><br/>Looks like he\\'s diverted<br/>all nonessential power<br/><br/>like heat and life support<br/>to the motors.<br/><br/>He\\'s gonna black out.<br/><br/>His blood gases are dropping.<br/><br/>Jonas.<br/><br/>Tell Heller<br/>I\\'m not slowing down.<br/><br/>Suyin, be advised.<br/><br/>Evolution is now en route.<br/><br/>Request you return<br/>to Mana One immediately.<br/><br/>Negative.<br/><br/>He can give us<br/>an escort on our way up.<br/><br/>Tell her to get<br/>out of the way, Mac.<br/><br/>More people means more risk<br/><br/>and she\\'s in<br/>way over her head.<br/><br/>Jonas, you just<br/>told her yourself.<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>The little green button<br/>on your intercom,<br/><br/>that\\'s for single channel<br/>communication.<br/><br/>Brilliant.<br/><br/>Entering thermocline.<br/><br/>Okay, Mac.<br/><br/>I am through.<br/><br/>Warning.<br/><br/>Pressure load<br/>approaching 16,000 psi.<br/><br/>At this speed,<br/><br/>I\\'m gonna have to divert<br/>power from the heaters<br/><br/>and shut down anything<br/>that could ice over.<br/><br/>Call you from the other side.<br/><br/>You got Wi-Fi here?<br/><br/>All right.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>Just... Just keep<br/>pressure on that.<br/><br/>Toshi, is it still out there?<br/><br/>I can\\'t tell.<br/><br/>I can\\'t see anything<br/>right now.<br/><br/>Oh.<br/><br/>There it is.<br/><br/>I\\'ve got visual<br/>on the Origin.<br/><br/>I can see most of it.<br/><br/>Okay. They\\'re alive.<br/><br/>I\\'m going to set up to tow.<br/><br/>Range to target. Six meters.<br/><br/>Four meters.<br/><br/>Target locked.<br/><br/>Firing magnetic hook.<br/><br/>Three. Two.<br/><br/>Suyin? Are you okay?<br/>What\\'s happening?<br/><br/>There is something<br/>down here.<br/><br/>Something just hit my ship.<br/><br/>Suyin, what\\'s happening?<br/><br/>It\\'s a huge squid.<br/><br/>It\\'s got the glider.<br/><br/>Warning.<br/>Capsule pressure.<br/><br/>Mac, it\\'s crushing me.<br/>It\\'s crushing me!<br/><br/>I don\\'t think<br/>the glider can take it.<br/><br/>It\\'s not gonna hold.<br/><br/>Suyin, engage<br/>the pressure compensator.<br/><br/>Compensator<br/>will not engage.<br/><br/>Capsule breach in ten seconds.<br/><br/>Capsule breach in five sec...<br/><br/>My God!<br/><br/>It\\'s a shark.<br/><br/>It\\'s like 20, 25 meters.<br/><br/>It\\'s a megalodon.<br/><br/>Impossible.<br/><br/>I\\'m so glad I\\'m not crazy.<br/><br/>Suyin, power down.<br/><br/>It\\'s drawn to the light.<br/><br/>Shut everything down<br/>and stay dark.<br/><br/>Shutdown in 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Shutting off<br/>everything but comms.<br/><br/>It\\'s circling back.<br/><br/>Here it comes, Suyin.<br/><br/>Shutdown in 25 seconds.<br/><br/>Suyin, there\\'s no time.<br/><br/>Turn off your lights.<br/><br/>Shutdown in 20 seconds.<br/><br/>Turn them off.

One, two, three.<br/><br/>She\\'s coming.<br/><br/>Let\\'s move.<br/><br/>If that thing hits us<br/>while we\\'re still attached...<br/><br/>Then we\\'re all gonna die.<br/><br/>Come on, I\\'ve got you.<br/><br/>It\\'s gonna be close.<br/><br/>Come on, move, move!<br/><br/>Go! Go! Go!<br/><br/>We\\'re not<br/>gonna make it.<br/><br/>- Come on.<br/>- Toshi, hurry!<br/><br/>Toshi, no!<br/><br/>Come in, Evolution.<br/><br/>Jonas, come in.<br/><br/>Are you all okay?<br/><br/>Doctor Heller has vitals<br/>on Lori and The Wall,<br/><br/>but we don\\'t have Toshi.<br/><br/>Is Toshi okay?<br/><br/>Jonas, is Toshi okay?<br/><br/>- All right.<br/>- Nice and easy.<br/><br/>Yeah. Yep.<br/><br/>- Don\\'t move her neck.<br/>- Careful.<br/><br/>That\\'s good.<br/>Grab a hold. We got her.<br/><br/>You couldn\\'t bring<br/>Toshi back?<br/><br/>- Why not?<br/>- He closed the hatch.<br/><br/>He saved us.<br/><br/>You left him.<br/><br/>You left him<br/>because that\\'s who you are.<br/><br/>You are the guy<br/>who leaves people behind.<br/><br/>You go that deep,<br/><br/>you take your life<br/>in your hands.<br/><br/>It was your choice<br/>to send them down.<br/><br/>This is why<br/>I don\\'t do this anymore, Mac.<br/><br/>How is she?<br/><br/>Well, the puncture<br/>just missed her liver.<br/><br/>She lost a lot of blood.<br/><br/>But she\\'s stable.<br/><br/>Jonas.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>You save Lori,<br/><br/>we can call it even.<br/><br/>I just want to apologize<br/>for before.<br/><br/>I was angry<br/>and I lose my temper.<br/><br/>And you did save my...<br/><br/>You\\'re naked.<br/><br/>I know you did all you could.<br/>So, thank you.<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>You\\'re welcome.<br/><br/>I know it\\'s not easy<br/>being the person who survives.<br/><br/>I\\'m gonna go now.<br/><br/>You should<br/>put on some clothes.<br/><br/>Yep. That\\'s the original plan.<br/><br/>Okay, then. Carry on.<br/><br/>Hi. Uh... I was...<br/><br/>It\\'s all good.<br/><br/>Jonas and Lori were the worst<br/>married couple ever, you know?<br/><br/>Uh-huh.<br/><br/>Whole experiment<br/>was over in a year.<br/><br/>I didn\\'t ask anything.<br/><br/>I know.<br/><br/>This is what<br/>attacked us. A megalodon.<br/><br/>How big is that thing?<br/><br/>Between 70 and 90 feet.<br/>21 to 27 meters.<br/><br/>The megalodon was the largest<br/>shark that ever existed.<br/><br/>It feared nothing.<br/><br/>It had no predators.<br/><br/>Its jaws were stronger<br/>than any other animal, ever.<br/><br/>The meg could bite<br/>a whale in half,<br/><br/>crushing through the bones.<br/><br/>We are<br/>in uncharted territory.<br/><br/>Until today<br/><br/>megalodons were thought<br/>to have been extinct<br/><br/>for over two million years.<br/><br/>- Wrong.<br/>- A living fossil.<br/><br/>That living fossil<br/>ate my friend.<br/><br/>I cannot begin<br/>to express<br/><br/>my sadness for Toshi\\'s death.<br/><br/>We have the discovery<br/>of a lifetime.<br/><br/>This is what Toshi worked for.<br/><br/>It\\'s what<br/>we\\'ve all worked for.<br/><br/>But we\\'re going<br/>to have to proceed slowly.<br/><br/>Yeah, that\\'s really<br/>not gonna work for me.<br/><br/>What is Mana One?<br/><br/>This station?<br/><br/>Yes. And what\\'s it doing?<br/><br/>Hmm? Right now.<br/><br/>Exactly.<br/><br/>Nothing.<br/><br/>20 million dollar rover, gone.<br/><br/>Thirty million dollar sub,<br/>gone.<br/><br/>You are now sitting<br/>in the most expensive<br/><br/>underwater marine<br/>biology day camp<br/><br/>in human history.<br/><br/>Hey, Crazy.<br/><br/>And now that<br/>we\\'ve actually<br/><br/>found something amazing,<br/><br/>we can\\'t proceed slowly.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>for keeping your promise.<br/><br/>- You\\'re welcome.<br/>- You don\\'t quit<br/><br/>trying to get to the Moon<br/>because you lose an astronaut.<br/><br/>You charge forward,<br/><br/>or someone else<br/>will get there first.<br/><br/>Other people will want<br/>a piece of this thing,<br/><br/>whether we like it or not.<br/><br/>You seem to like it.<br/><br/>- Excuse me?<br/>- I said, you seem to like it.<br/><br/>I\\'m sorry.<br/>Is he part of this team?<br/><br/>You\\'re damn right<br/>he\\'s a part of this team.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>You ever think<br/>that Mother Nature<br/><br/>might know what she\\'s doing?<br/><br/>The thermocline might<br/>just be there for a reason?<br/><br/>Hey, look, you wanna explore?<br/>Go ahead, explore.<br/><br/>But if you start sending<br/>people back down there,<br/><br/>don\\'t call me<br/>to come save your asses.<br/><br/>Because in case what happened<br/>down there<br/><br/>wasn\\'t clear to you,<br/><br/>man vs. meg isn\\'t a fight.<br/><br/>It\\'s a slaughter.<br/><br/>O-Level.<br/><br/>What you people discovered<br/>is an even bigger goldmine<br/><br/>than we ever thought<br/>possible.<br/><br/>We are completely unprepared<br/><br/>to deal with creatures<br/>like megalodon.<br/><br/>I understand,<br/>and we can get prepared.<br/><br/>I\\'m talking about<br/>a long-term plan.<br/><br/>That\\'s gonna be<br/>the other alternative.<br/><br/>What\\'s that?<br/><br/>My daughter.<br/><br/>Jonas.<br/><br/>- Did you see Meiying?<br/>- We can\\'t find Meiying.<br/><br/>Meiying? Meiying?<br/><br/>- I\\'ll take this way.<br/>- Let\\'s try this way.<br/><br/>Meiying.<br/><br/>Meiying?<br/><br/>- Meiying.<br/>- Mama.<br/><br/>Are you okay?<br/><br/>There\\'s a monster<br/>and it\\'s watching us.<br/><br/>It\\'s okay.<br/>It\\'s just a whale.<br/><br/>Wait. Where\\'s Lucy?<br/><br/>Where\\'s the mom?<br/><br/>Is the station all right?<br/>Report.<br/><br/>No leaks. No visible damage.<br/><br/>All right, team.<br/>Initiate emergency protocols.<br/><br/>And nobody is to go<br/>near the water.<br/><br/>If you insist.<br/><br/>Turn off<br/>all the underwater lighting.<br/><br/>Restrict the crew<br/>to essential areas.<br/><br/>You said it was impossible<br/>for it to get up here.<br/><br/>It should have been.<br/><br/>You guys,<br/>take a look at this.<br/><br/>When the glider came up,<br/>the thermocline was intact,<br/><br/>so it was<br/>one degree Celsius, right?<br/><br/>Yeah.<br/><br/>But a minute later,<br/>when the Evolution came up,<br/><br/>the temperature increased<br/>by 25 degrees.<br/><br/>A shark could come<br/>right through there.<br/><br/>20 sharks for that matter.<br/><br/>When the meg hit the Origin,<br/><br/>it slammed into<br/>a thermal vent.<br/><br/>Those can release millions<br/>of gallons per minute.<br/><br/>The heat from that vent<br/>cleared the path<br/><br/>through the freezing<br/>cold layer.<br/><br/>Are you saying we opened up<br/><br/>a super highway<br/>for giant sharks?<br/><br/>Not exactly. It seems like<br/>it was a transitory event.<br/><br/>The temperatures<br/>are returned to normal<br/><br/>and the gap is closed.<br/><br/>Yeah. But not before a massive<br/>prehistoric killing machine<br/><br/>decided to come up<br/>and say \"Hi.\"<br/><br/>Hey, look, we\\'re wasting time.<br/>That thing\\'s out there.<br/><br/>We need to find it<br/>and kill it.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>We can\\'t. We should explore<br/>non-lethal options first.<br/><br/>For the meg or for us?<br/><br/>Attention.<br/><br/>I\\'ve got<br/>an emergency locator beacon.<br/><br/>20 miles south, southwest.<br/><br/>What does that mean?<br/><br/>It means<br/>a boat has gone down.<br/><br/>- Attention.<br/>- Three boats.<br/><br/>That\\'s the meg.<br/>We need to get there. Now.<br/><br/>Mac! I found something!<br/><br/>These sharks have no fins.<br/><br/>They were killed<br/>by shark poachers.<br/><br/>They cut off the fins and<br/>throw the shark back to die.<br/><br/>All for a bowl of soup.<br/><br/>Looks like the meg<br/>evened the score.<br/><br/>One fish did all this?<br/><br/>Ask it yourself.<br/><br/>Okay.<br/><br/>We have a shark cage<br/>and spearguns on board.<br/><br/>If we can shoot the meg<br/><br/>in a soft spot<br/>like it\\'s mouth or gills,<br/><br/>we can inject it<br/>with something lethal.<br/><br/>Whoa! Whoa, whoa.<br/><br/>It\\'s gonna take at least<br/>20 minutes to rig the cage.<br/><br/>And that thing<br/>will be gone in two.<br/><br/>Why don\\'t you just<br/>put a tracker on it?<br/><br/>Don\\'t you guys<br/>ever watch Shark Week?<br/><br/>You have one of those, like,<br/>GPS tracker tag thingamajigs.<br/><br/>Keep an eye on the shark<br/>till the cage is ready.<br/><br/>We should be able<br/>to put a tracking dart<br/><br/>in that dorsal fin.<br/><br/>You\\'re welcome.<br/><br/>Yeah, but somehow<br/><br/>we have to get this boat<br/>next to that meg.<br/><br/>No, we can\\'t.<br/><br/>It\\'s already proven<br/>aggressive towards boats.<br/><br/>The safest way to approach<br/>is without a vehicle.<br/><br/>Hold up. Hold up.<br/><br/>You want someone<br/>to swim out there?<br/><br/>To a prehistoric shark<br/>that ate our friend?<br/><br/>Actually, one of us alone<br/>in the water is no threat.<br/><br/>Okay, who the hell<br/>is gonna make that swim?<br/><br/>Let\\'s draw straws.<br/><br/>I can\\'t swim.<br/><br/>Uh...<br/><br/>Sorry, my body<br/>made me say that.<br/><br/>You sure about this?<br/><br/>Not really.<br/><br/>If I get eaten,<br/>you\\'re gonna feel really bad.<br/><br/>This tracker rifle<br/>only has a 100-foot range.<br/><br/>100 feet?<br/><br/>Get really close<br/>before you shoot.<br/><br/>Great.<br/><br/>If you want me<br/>to go instead, I will.<br/><br/>I got this, Mac.<br/><br/>Okay, good,<br/>\\'cause I was lying.<br/><br/>Be safe.<br/><br/>Yeah, thanks, pal.<br/><br/>I hope you\\'re right<br/>about this.<br/><br/>Me, too.<br/><br/>I\\'m an idiot.<br/><br/>I am proceeding to<br/>the enormous killer shark.<br/><br/>Yeah, we got you, Jonas.<br/><br/>Sharks are<br/>attracted to panic motion.<br/><br/>Keep it nice and smooth.<br/><br/>It\\'s all gonna be fine.<br/><br/>Oh, boy,<br/>it\\'s going under.<br/><br/>He\\'s done it.<br/><br/>Mac, tracker is live!<br/><br/>Great!<br/>Reel him in, DJ.<br/><br/>Stop!

As this is happening, </i>Vers<i> is seen walking down the stairs towards sub-level 6 with Coulson and another agent on the flight of stairs above her]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Agent:</b> Fury\\'s colluding with the target.\\n</p>, <p><b>Coulson:</b> Then why did he call us in?\\n</p>, <p><b>Agent:</b> All I know is that we take him in too. Dead or alive.\\n</p>, <p><b>Coulson:</b> Dead or alive?\\n</p>, <p><i>[</i>Vers<i>, standing directly underneath them hears this conversation and, after a moment of contemplation, decides to turn back around and walk up the stairs to find Fury. Fury is then seen hiding at the end of an aisle of cupboards, peeking his head around one side before throwing an empty can across the room. The lights suddenly turn on and a team of agents runs towards the can. Fury then walks through the aisle, before peering his head around. However, when Fury does this, the director points a gun at his head]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Director:</b> Is it something I said?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Fury hits the gun away from his head, leading to a long struggle between the two men with the Director being victorious]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Director:</b> Now you know, I don\\'t really need these to see <i>(holding up his glasses which were knocked off during the fight)</i>. But, they do kinda complete the look <i>(the Director\\'s voice suddenly changes into the voice of Skrull General Talos)</i>. Don\\'t you think?\\n</p>, <p><i>[During this monologue, the Director advances towards Fury, who is lying on his back in defeat. However, an energy blast suddenly appears blasting straight into his chest and sending him flying backward. Several teams of agents suddenly appear standing near the Director, with their guns drawn. But the camera tilts to show a hole burnt through the roof, and </i>Vers<i> and Fury running along a corridor on the level above]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers: </b>You called them in?\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> My bad!\\n</p>, <p><i>[</i>Vers<i> and Fury turn a corner, and they are suddenly running up a flight of stairs however, Coulson is standing direclty above them with his gun drawn. </i>Vers\\'<i> hand lights up but Coulson lowers his weapon before letting both of them walk through the door behind them]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Agent:</b> Coulson, you have eyes on them?\\n</p>, <p><b>Coulson:</b> They\\'re not down here. Let\\'s try up there.\\n</p>, <p><i>[</i>Vers<i> and Fury then sprint out of the corridor before barricading the door behind them with a piece of metal. </i>Vers<i> then holds out her hand, expecting Fury to give her something. When he doesn\\'t, she hits him and holds her hand out again]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> What?\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Your communicator. You obviously can\\'t be trusted with it.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Fury hands over his pager, as the agents slam into the door behind them. The agents are heard struggling, but </i>Vers<i> and Fury run over towards cover. The agents eventually push through, but </i>Vers<i> and Fury are already hidden behind a tower of boxes. </i>Vers<i> then observes her surroundings, looking for a way out before hitting Fury and gesturing towards a plane, which has a striking resemblance to a Star Wars ship. The agents continue to search, even walking past were </i>Vers<i> and Fury were hiding, but the duo are already in the cockpit]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Do you know how to fly this thing?\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Uh... we\\'ll see.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> That\\'s a yes or no question.\\n</p>, <p><i>[</i>Vers<i> purposefully plays with a few switches, causing the engine to roar to life and the wings to extend]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Yes.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Director hears the engine come to life and turns around to see the plane alive. </i>Vers<i> then pushes a lever forward and causes the plane to lift]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> That\\'s what I\\'m talking about!\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Director and the agents shoot meaninglessly at the plane, but the plane continues to lift off and fly normally. </i>Vers<i> flies the plane out of the underground tarmac area, and over the open desert before the plane begins gaining altitude quickly. Suddenly, a meowing sound can be heard from the back of the plane. Both </i>Vers<i> and Fury turn to see Goose pushed against a crate]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> We\\'ve got a stowaway.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Hang on Goose.\\n</p>, <p><i>[</i>Vers<i> then stops the plane from gaining altitude and Goose pushes himself off the crate, onto his four legs. Goose then happily walks up to the cockpit before trying to climb into </i>Vers\\'<i> lap. </i>Vers<i> pick him up and places him on the console before Goose lies down]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Who\\'s a good kitty huh? Huh Goose? Yes, that\\'s right. Who\\'s a good kitty Goose? You\\'re a good kitty.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Goose responds to Fury by lying down comfortably and staring at him]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> See anyone you know? Funny story... I arrived on Hala, near dead, no memory... That was six years ago.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> So you think you\\'re the pilot that went down with Dr Lawson.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> I\\'m saying that the last person to see them alive can probably tell us.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Maria Rambeau.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Mmhmm.

Guess he doesn\\'t hate me yet.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Yeah well, give him time.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> I guess he had a feeling, went with his gut against orders. It\\'s a really hard thing to do. That\\'s what keeps us human.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> I get in trouble for that. A lot.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> I see that about you <i>(</i>Vers<i> and Fury laugh about this)</i>. Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls. I guess that\\'s not standard Kree operating procedure.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Well, I won\\'t tell your boss if you don\\'t tell mine.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The scene then changes to the Kree ship approaching a jump-point.

To lure our operative Vers to talk for her kidnapper.\\n</p>, <p><b>Ronan:</b> Give us the location, we\\'ll take care of the terrorist threat.\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> By bombing them out of the galaxy. No. We\\'ll handle this.\\n</p>, <p><b>Ronan:</b> Several Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere. Where are they?\\n</p>, <p><b>Korath:</b> They are...\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> Lost.

On closer inspection, Maria Rambo is tinkering on a workstation beside a small two-seater plane. </i>Vers<i> approaches Maria carefully, almost unsure of what to say or do. Once </i>Vers<i> speaks, Monica Rambeau quickly exits the plane she was exploring]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Excuse me, I\\'m looking for Maria Rambeau.\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> Aunty Carol?

She stands next to the stove, with one hand on the kettle and begins heating it up, her hand glowing blue and orange. When this starts, Monica stands up, both fascinated and curious, and walks over to the stove. Quickly, the kettle begins to boil, blowing steam out and making a whistling noise]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> No way. That\\'s so cool.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Oh, ho.

Little moments, but I can\\'t tell what\\'s real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning, maybe it\\'ll all make sense?\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> You woke me up, banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then we had to get up so early, the Air Force still wasn\\'t letting women fly combat, so testing Lawson\\'s planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered. And you wanted to race to base, in your old Mustang, and I wasn\\'t about to argue, \\'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated, took a shortcut.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers: </b>Since when is a shortcut cheating?\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Since it violates the pre-determined rules of engagement.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> I definitely don\\'t remember those.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Mmm, of course you don\\'t. <i>(both Maria and </i>Vers<i> laugh for a bit)</i> When I got to the hanger, Lawson was agitated, she said \\'she had lives to save\\'.

The kind of moment we\\'ve both been waiting for. The Doc was always unique. That\\'s why I liked her. But, now you\\'re saying she\\'s from another planet.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> I know this must be hard for you.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> What, this part right here? No, no. Know what\\'s hard? Losing my best friend, in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened. Hard... is knowing you were out there somewhere, too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after 6 years... with your super-charged fire-hands and you expect me to call you... I don\\'t even know what... \\'Vers\\'?

And this is how you right after you graduated... <i>(Monica continues to talk, but the words start to mix together)</i>.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The camera pans over all the photos which Monica has shown and is showing to </i>Vers<i>. In addition to the other photos, there is one of her Air Force graduation, one of her squadron standing in front of a plane, one of her and Monica carving a pumpkin and another of </i>Vers<i> dressed as Janis Joplin]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> Oh wait. I forgot, your jacket. Mom doesn\\'t let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Monica runs off to retrieve </i>Vers\\'<i> jacket. Once Monica has left, </i>Vers<i> looks at the pictures again, pushing them around to better see ones underneath. </i>Vers<i> continues looking through the pictures before she comes across her old dog tag, which has been burnt]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The door knocks, and Maria moves forward to answer the door]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Don\\'t answer that.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> It\\'s just my neighbor.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> They can change into anyone.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Fury and </i>Vers<i> walk towards the door and try to see who is outside. </i>Vers<i> answers the door and stares unfriendly at Maria\\'s neighbor, Tom]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Tom:</b> Hi there.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> What do you want?\\n</p>, <p><b>Tom:</b> Ummm...\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Hey Tom. This is my friend Carol.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tom:</b> Pleased to meet you. Yow! Static electricity out here\\'s no joke.

Okay?\\n</p>, <p><b>Tom:</b> Uhh...\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Okay.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Maria closes the door, but </i>Vers<i> continues to stare at Tom. Once Maria has closed the door, a voice is heard behind them. Fury draws his weapon and aims it towards the voice, </i>Vers\\'<i> hands light up and Maria stands there confused]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors. You never know when you\\'re gonna need to borrow some sugar.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Talos takes a sip of the milkshake he is holding while Carol begins to advance towards him, her hands glowing more now]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> Now, hang on a second, before you go swinging those jazz hands around, making a mess in your friend\\'s house - and... it\\'s a lovely home.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Oh my God.

But I\\'m sure that you understand, I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vers:</b> Last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles.\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> That was before I knew who you were.

My best friend... who supported me as a mother, and a pilot when no one else did. You\\'re smart and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. And you are the most powerful person I knew, way before you could shoot fire from your fist. You hear me? You hear me?\\n</p>, <p><i>[The scene changes back to the inside of the barn, with Talos, a Skrull scientist, Fury, Carol and Maria standing around a table]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> I know I don\\'t deserve your trust but you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell\\'s core. Now, we know why. If only you knew, the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell\\'s lab.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Those weren\\'t coordinates. They\\'re safe vectors.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Orbital positioning and velocity.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> You didn\\'t find her lab on Earth, because it\\'s not on Earth.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we\\'ll find it, in orbit, right now.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> It\\'s just basic physics.\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you\\'re my science guy, right?\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Skrull scientists nods then looks down briefly, disappointed in himself]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Yon-Rogg will catch up to you soon.

Your science guy.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The scene changes to the inside of the hanger, with Talos and the Skrull scientist modifying the plane which Carol and Fury flew. The scene then changes back to the inside of the house, with Carol and Maria sitting opposite each other at a table]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Well, I could use a co-pilot.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> No. No, I... I can\\'t. I can\\'t leave Monica.\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> Why? It\\'s okay. I can stay with grandma and pop-pop.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> There\\'s no way I\\'m going baby. It\\'s too dangerous.\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> Testing brand new aerospace tech is dangerous. Didn\\'t you used to do that?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol looks at Maria, smiling smuggly]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey, and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologically superior foreign enemy. Correct?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol smiles and shrugs her shoulders.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> That\\'s what I\\'m saying. You have to go.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Monica...\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> You have the chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions. And you\\'re gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? I just think that you should consider the kind of example you\\'re setting for your daughter.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Maria looks towards Carol for help, but Carol is laughing at Maria\\'s position. Carol then gives Monica a thumbs up]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The scene then changes to the outside of the house, with Maria walking towards a car, with her parents inside. Monica sits on the front step watching the encounter. Carol then walks outside with her Kree suit on and sits beside Monica]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Your Mom\\'s lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble.\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> You remember.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Is that mine? <i>(Carol looks at the jacket sitting in Monica\\'s lap. However, Carol protests when Monica attempts to hand it over).</i> No, no. You hang onto it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can\\'t wear these Kree colors anymore, and since you\\'re obviously the only person around here with any sense of style...\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol stands up and presses a few buttons on her suit. Carol holds her arm out to Monica, allowing her to change the colors. She replaces the green with bright red and the yellow replacing the grey stripes]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> No.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to orange, blue and yellow]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> Uh-uh.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to black with neon lights lining the stripes]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Monica:</b> Definitely not. <i>(Both Carol and Monica laugh)</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Monica changes the color again, this time to a white suit with green stripes]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Well, since we\\'re on the same team...\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol gestures to Monica\\'s red, yellow and blue shirt. Monica then changes the colors to match her shirt.

Almost immediately, Yon-Rogg steps onto the path and walks down it. He walks down the path and into a small house in the middle of the forest.

Thanks for asking.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> PRY46-B...\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> No, no codes.

But you would never tell me who.\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> And what is your earliest memory of Hala?\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> The transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins.\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> Whose blood?\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol: </b><i>(Carol looks sideways, confused and stumbed)</i> Hmm.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Yon-Rogg shoots Carol, causing her to fly backward. Yon-Rogg then walks up to her and points his gun at her face]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> That\\'s my blood that\\'s coursing through her veins.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol suddenly turns into a Skrull]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> What have you done with her?\\n</p>, <p><b>Skrull:</b> You\\'re too late.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Yon-Rogg begins walking away before stopping and turning around]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> She knows?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Before the Skrull can answer, Yon-Rogg shoots him. He puts his gun back in its holster before calling Ronan with the hologram in his arm]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53. Come at once.\\n</p>, <p><b>Ronan:</b> For the good of all Kree, Commander the infestation will be eradicated.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The scene changes to the modified spaceship flying above the clouds before cutting to show Carol and Maria flying. The camera pans out to show Fury petting Goose and Talos looking at him uncomfortably]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Passing 500 and climbing.\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> You know, you really shouldn\\'t have that thing on your lap.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best. And as long as he continues to freak you out <i>(Fury picks up Goose and shoves him towards Talos\\' face. Talos jerks backward in his seat)</i> like that, yeah I\\'m gonna keep giving him all the love and hugs he needs, right?\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Can I ask you something? Do you just turn into anything you want?\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> Ah well, I have to see it first.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Can you all do it?\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> Physiologically, yeah.

Buckle up, folks.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol pushes down a lever, causing the plane to suddenly climb further into the sky. In the plane, everybody is pushed back into their seats]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Hey. Is this normal, like space turbulence?\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Pretty much.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol smiles at Fury\\'s question, while Talos just looks towards him and shakes his head. The plane continues to fly directly upwards, inside the plane everything begins floating. Carol and Maria\\'s hair begins floating along with a few pens from the console between their seats. Similarly, Goose is floating upside down until Fury extends his arm, which Goose eagerly grabs onto. Maria then flicks a switch and gravity suddenly turns on inside the plane, and everything returns to normal]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Locking in coordinate grid.\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Where is it?\\n</p>, <p><i>[The view switches to the outside of the ship, showing the ship sitting in empty space with Earth below it]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> It\\'s here. It\\'s gotta be here.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol realizes something and pulls out the computer in her arm. After a few swipes, the computer lights up]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Computer:</b> Decloaking activated.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Suddenly, a bright light appears from the empty space and a massive laboratory becomes visible. The title \"Mar-Vell\\'s Laboratory, Kree Imperial Cruiser\" appears on the screen. Carol flies the spaceship into the laboratory and the four disembark the plane and begin walking through the corridors]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The four walk into a giant room, with the Tesseract sitting in the reactor on one side of the room. Goose jumps onto the reactor and scratches the Tesseract, intrigued by the bright light. Carol and Maria follow behind him]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Is that it? The core?\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> In her notes, she called it the Tesseract.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol reaches out and grabs the Tesseract from its position in the reactor.

What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Maria picks up and lunchbox and opens it. Carol then places the Tesseract inside before closing the box. Fury then coughs and gestures towards a cup of tea, which is still steaming]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> We\\'re not alone.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Talos begins singing loudly. Suddenly, a swarm of scared Skrulls appear from their hiding places. Suddenly a Skrull runs towards Talos and hugs himi]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Soren:</b> Talos!\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> He didn\\'t come here for the Tesseract.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Soren calls a child to come towards her and Talos. The child comes willingly, and Talos leans down to get a better look at him]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Soren:</b> It\\'s okay. We didn\\'t know what to do. Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason or the Kree would find us.\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> You did the right thing.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Once Soren noticed that Carol, Maria, and Fury are standing in the room, she tries to back away but Talos stops her]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> It\\'s okay, it\\'s okay. She\\'s alright. She\\'s a friend.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> I\\'m not gonna hurt you.\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> She led me to you.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> I\\'m so sorry.

There\\'s thousands of us separated from each other... scattered throughout the galaxy.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Talos\\' daughter walks over to Carol, holds her hand and directs her towards the pinball machine in the corner. When they get there, the child points to the high score in glowing lights. The child jumps excitedly and asks her to play]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> If I played the same pinball machine for six years I\\'d have some high scores too.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Suddenly the doors to the lab open, and Yon-Rogg and his team walk through]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> Fraternizing with the enemy?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Fury draws his gun but Minn-Erva already has hers pointed directly towards him. When she gestures for him to drop it, he raises his hands in surrender and returns the gun to its holster. Yon-Rogg walks towards Carol and throws Goose along the floor towards her. When the camera pans, Talos has positioned Soren behind her, Fury and Maria are both unarmed and the Kree\\'s have surrounded the four]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> What did you do to your uniform?\\n</p>, <p><b>Minn-Erva:</b> They got in her head. Just like we thought.\\n</p>, <p><b>Korath:</b> The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.\\n</p>, <p><b>Talos:</b> You can see they\\'re not soldiers, let them go. You can have me.\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> And the core?\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> You lied to me.\\n</p>, <p><b>Yon-Rogg:</b> I made you a better version of yourself. What\\'s given can be taken away.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol tries to light up her fists but they just spark uselessly before eventually dying out. The chip in her neck has also turned off. Instead of using her powers, Carol runs towards Yon-Rog and begins punching him. This results in a fist fight between the two. Quickly, Yon-Rogg lights up a gadget in his suit. The gadget glowed bright blue and caused Carol to lean back in an attempt to avoid it. Around her, the Kree are attacking the Skrulls, forcing them to kneel. Yon-Rogg then jerks his arm away from Carol, causing her to fall onto the ground]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[When Carol wakes up, the Supreme Intelligence machine is attached to her. She is kneeling with her hands bound in front of her. When Carol meets the Supreme Intelligence, a record is playing beside her and a long table is sitting in front of her, a few meters away with Dr. Lawson sitting at the only seat]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> There she is. Seems like you time on C-53 jogged the old memory. This jacket? It\\'s killer by the way.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Supreme Intelligence stands up and begins dancing to the music]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> The music, it\\'s a nice touch.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Let... me... out.\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> No can do.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> With what exactly?

The Kree are still surrounding the Skrulls, and Goose is being scanned with a Kree scanner]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Scanner:</b> Species: Flerken. Threat: High.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Bron-Char begins putting a muzzle on Goose\\'s head, but is met by protests from Fury]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> It\\'s a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.\\n</p>, <p><b>Scanner:</b> Species: Human male. Threat: Low to none.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> That thing is clearly busted.\\n</p>, <p><b>Minn-Erva:</b> Load the Flerken onto the heli.

Carol has just finished standing up after the pain in her neck]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> You did good, ace. Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> I used to believe your lies. But the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You\\'re talking about destroying them because they won\\'t submit to your rule. And neither will I.\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> We found you. We embraced you as our own.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> You stole me. From my home, my family, my friends.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Carol runs forward and jumps to punch Lawson, however, her hand travels right through Lawson\\'s skull. Lawson then throws Carol into a wall, leaving Carol hanging sideways]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> It\\'s cute how hard you try. Remember... without us...you\\'re weak. <i>(Carol pushes herself behind the wall, and sees a screen of her younger memories on Earth playing)</i> You\\'re flawed. Helpless. We saved you.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The screen of Carol\\'s failures continues to play, until she suddenly drops, falling into nothingness until suddenly landing on the floor]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Supreme Intelligence:</b> Without us... you\\'re only human.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> You\\'re right.

She suddenly blasts energy from her hands, and sends four Kree flying backward in to the wall behind them. She grabs the lunchbox with the Tesseract and finds Maria and Fury]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> You know you\\'re glowing, right?\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> I\\'ll explain it later. <i>(Carol opens the lunchbox to reveal the Tesseract glowing inside)</i> Take the Tesseract, leaving the lunchbox.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> <i>(Fury has just unbuckled Goose\\'s collar and is now holding her)</i> Me?\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Yes.\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> I\\'m not touching that thing.\\n</p>, <p><b>Carol:</b> Want me to get you an oven mitt?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Goose suddenly lurches himself out of Fury\\'s arms and giant tentacles emerge from inside Goose\\'s mouth.

She lights up her fists, preparing to fire, but Yon-Rogg drops the ship, catching her by surprise. She activates her helmet and holds onto the pod tightly. Meanwhile, Minn-Erva starts shooting at the Quadjet and Maria barely dodges the bullets while flying through the desert. Carol attempts to shoot Yon-Rogg again, but she is sent backwards by his magnitron device. She falls down to Earth, but she manages to calm and control her powers right before hitting the ground, which allows her to fly back up. Meanwhile Minn-Erva continues to chase down the Skrulls, as the two spaceships enter a canyon. Maria evades the bullets with ease and takes a shortcut, allowing her to be in front of Minn-Erva\\'s pod and destroy it with blasts.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Fury:</b> Ha ha!\\n</p>, <p><b>Maria:</b> Yes!

NICELAND - DAY\\nWRECK-IT RALPH is asleep inside his stump. A voice-over kicks\\nin, sounding more like a confessional than a traditional V.O.\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nMy name’s Ralph, and I’m a Bad Guy.\\nI’m 9 feet tall. I weigh 643\\npounds. Got a little bit of a\\ntemper on me. You know, my passions\\nbubble very near the surface, not\\ngonna lie.\\nA bulldozer removes Ralph and the stump. Ralph’s head pops \\nout of the stump.\\nRALPH (ON-SCREEN)\\nHey, you moved my stump!\\nARRRGGHHHHHH!\\nRalph throws a bit of a tantrum.\\nThe NICELAND APARTMENTS are constructed where the stump was.\\nRALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)\\nAnyhoo, what else? I’m a wrecker. I\\nwreck -- professionally.\\nRalph appears on screen in front of the Niceland Apartments.\\nRALPH (ON-SCREEN) (CONT’D)\\nI’M GONNA WRECK IT!\\nRalph wrecks the building. He throws a Nicelander.\\nRALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)\\nI’m very good at what I do.\\nProbably the best I know.\\n\\nNICELANDERS :\\nFIX IT FELIX!!!\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nThing is, fixing is the name of the\\ngame. Literally, figuratively,\\nmeta... physically...\\nFIX-IT FELIX arrives and starts fixing.\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\n\\nFELIX :\\nI CAN FIX IT!!!\\nRALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)\\n\\nPage 2/120\\n\\n\\x0cSo yeah, naturally the guy with the\\nname Fix-it Felix is the good guy.\\nHe’s nice enough as good guys go.\\nDefinitely fixes stuff really well.\\nBut if you’ve got a magic hammer \\nfrom your father, how hard can it\\nbe...?\\n\\nMARY :\\nYOO-HOO!\\nMARY pops up in a window with a pie. Felix eats the pie, and\\na protective hard-hat appears on his head.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nI guarantee you if he had a\\nstandard issue hammer like the kind \\nyou’d get at the hardware store-- \\nhe would not be able to fix the \\nthings I wreck as quickly.\\nThe damage is repaired. The screen reads “YOU FIXED IT!”\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nWhen Felix does a good job, he gets\\na medal.\\nA Nicelander places a little medal around Felix’s neck and \\ngives him a peck on the cheek.\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nAre there medals for the sweet \\nscience of wrecking? To that I say,\\n“Ha.”\\nThe Nicelanders pick up Ralph and thrown him off the roof.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nAhhhhhhhh!\\nHe lands on the ground in the mud. KER-PLUNK.\\nRALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)\\n... And no, there are not.\\nWe pull back from the game console. We’re in...\\nLITWAK’S FAMILY FUN CENTER\\nThe place is bustling.\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\n\\nCHIRON:\\nRALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)\\nIt’s not like I’m complaining.\\n\\nPage 3/120\\n\\n\\x0cWell, it’s a little like I’m \\ncomplaining. But I get it. I been\\ndoing this long enough to know a\\nsteady arcade gig’s nothing to \\nsneeze at.\\nTIME LAPSE -- The arcade expands over the years. Games get\\nwheeled out. New games get wheeled in. Owner LARRY LITWAK\\ntakes real good care of the place through the years.\\nRALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)\\nSeen a lotta games come and go. I\\nthink about all those guys from\\nAsteroids? Boom! Gone. Centipede?\\nWho knows where that guy is. No, I\\nknow I’m very lucky.\\n\\nCHIRON:\\nRALPH (V.O.) (CONT’D)\\nIt’s just after so many years, it \\nbecomes kind of hard to love your\\njob when no one seems to like you\\nfor doing it.\\nThe arcade is older now, and all the games are more modern. A\\ngiant first-person shooter game gets wheeled in. The arcade\\ncloses. The “Open” sign shuts off.\\nThe Dance Dance Revolution screen is visible in the \\nbackground. On it we see a cycle of the dancer dancing. The\\ndancer suddenly stops, peeks toward the darkened “Open” sign.\\n\\nINSET THE GAME:\\n\\nDANCER :\\n(calling out)\\nTHAT’S IT! ARCADE’S CLOSED!\\nShe and her back-up dancers limp off, rubbing their\\nshoulders, limping, stretching after a long day of dancing.\\nINSET STREET FIGHTER GAME CONSOLE: Two fighters, RYU and KEN\\nstop beating each other.\\n\\nRYU :\\nWhat a day.

NICELAND - DAY\\nThe game is now in hyper-realistic 3-D.\\n\\nFELIX :\\nGood job, everyone!\\nFelix and the Nicelanders exit the roof as we pan down the\\nbuilding and get a sense of the world.\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nI dunno, maybe I wouldn’t be \\nfeeling this way if things were\\ndifferent after work. But as it is, \\nFelix and the Nicelanders go hang\\nout in their homes-- which he’s \\njust fixed.\\nRalph picks himself up from the mud. He watches sadly as the\\nNicelanders ignore him and carry Felix to the penthouse.\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nAnd I head off to the pile of\\ngarbage in the dump... where I\\nlive. You might call it a lonely\\ncesspit of despair on the outskirts\\nof humanity...which would be\\naccurate. But I call it home.\\nRalph climbs up the brick pile he calls home.\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nI guess I can’t bellyache too much;\\nI got my bricks. I got my stump.\\nHe pummels the bricks into dust and pulls a pile of bricks\\nover him like a blanket. He stares longingly at the building.\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\nIt looks uncomfortable, but it’s \\nactually fine. I’m good.\\n\\nCLOSE ON:\\nRALPH (V.O.)\\n\\nPage 5/120\\n\\n\\x0cBut... if I’m really honest with \\nmyself, I see Felix up there,\\ngetting pies all the time, acting\\nlike Captain Fancy.

Pull back to reveal...\\nINT. VIDEO GAME (LIKE A CHURCH BASEMENT) - NIGHT\\nRalph sits in a room full of VIDEO GAME BAD GUYS. A sign on\\n\\nthe wall reads:\\n\\nCLYDE :\\nNice share, Ralph. As fellow Bad\\nGuys, we’ve all felt what you’re \\nfeeling, and we’ve come to terms \\nwith it.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nReally?\\n\\nZANGIEF:\\n(thick Russian accent)\\nRight here. I am Zangief. I am Bad\\nGuy.\\n\\nOTHER BAD GUYS :\\nHi Zangief.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nHi Zangief.\\n\\nZANGIEF :\\nI relate to you, Ralph. When I hit\\nbottom, I was crushing man’s skull\\n\\nPage 6/120\\n\\n\\x0c(MORE)\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\nZANGIEF (CONT'D)\\nlike sparrow egg between my thighs.\\n(smacking his thigh)\\nAnd I am wondering, why do you have\\nto be so bad, Zangief? Why can’t \\nmore like good guy? Then I have\\nmoment of clarity: If Zangief is\\ngood guy, who will crush man’s \\nskull like sparrow egg between\\nthighs? And I say, “Zangief, you \\nare bad guy. But this does not mean\\nyou are bad guy.”\\nClaps of understanding.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nRight. I’m sorry, you lost me\\nthere.\\n\\nZOMBIE :\\n(thick Zombie accent)\\nArrhh. Zombie. Bad Guy.\\n\\nOTHER BAD GUYS :\\nHi Zombie.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nHi Zombie.\\n\\nZOMBIE :\\n\\nZangief saying:\\nhappy -- good, bad...\\n(Frankenstein growl)\\nYou must love you.\\nCY-BORG \\nYeah!

Watch out; it’s \\ndripping.\\n\\nPage 7/120\\n\\n\\x0cCLYDE :\\n\\nQuestion Ralph:\\nyou to BadAnon for years now, and\\ntonight you finally show up. Why is\\nthat?\\n\\nRALPH :\\nI don’t know, I just felt like \\ncoming.... I suppose it has\\nsomething to do with the fact that,\\n(MORE)\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\nRALPH (CONT'D) \\nwell, today is 30th Anniversary of \\nmy game.\\n\\nSATAN :\\nHappy Anniversary, Ralph.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nThanks, Satan.\\n\\nSATAN :\\nIt’s sai-tine, actually.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nGot it. But here’s the thing...\\n(exhales, then)\\nI don’t want to be the bad guy \\nanymore.\\nGASPS. Bowser spits out his coffee and thus fire.\\nCY-BORG \\nYou can’t mess with the program, \\nRalph.\\nM. BISON \\n(miming “crazy”)\\nYou’re not going Turbo, are you?\\n\\nRALPH :\\nTurbo? No, I’m not going Turbo. \\nCome on guys. Is it Turbo to want a\\nfriend, or a medal, or a piece of\\npie every once in a while? Is it\\n\\nPage 8/120\\n\\n\\x0cturbo to want more out of life?\\n\\nZOMBIE :\\nYeeeeesssss.\\n\\nCLYDE :\\nRalph, Ralph, we get it. But we\\ncan’t change who we are, and the \\nsooner you accept that the better\\noff your game and your life will\\nbe.\\n\\nZANGIEF :\\nHey, one game at a time, Ralph.\\n\\nCLYDE :\\nNow let’s close out with the Bad \\nGuy Affirmation.\\nThey all get up, hold hands.\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\n\\nALL BAD GUYS :\\nI’m bad. And that’s good. I will \\nnever be good. And that’s not bad. \\nThere’s no one I’d rather be than \\nme.\\nRalph doesn’t say the Affirmation. His eyes are wide open-- a\\nnon-believer.\\nThe TITLE burns in over Ralph:\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\n\\nCLYDE :\\nOkay gang, see you next week.\\nThe bad guys break the circle. Satan puts a supportive hand\\non Ralph’s back.\\n\\nSATAN :\\nHang in there, Ralph.\\n\\nCLYDE :\\nHey Zombie, don’t forget your\\nhatchets.\\nWe pull out to see that the meeting was held in the center\\nroom of Pac-Man. Ralph filches two cherries and catches up\\n\\nPage 9/120\\n\\n\\x0cwith the others.\\nTUNNEL TO GAME CENTRAL STATION\\nThe bad guys climb onto a train car and shove off down the\\ntracks. Ralph sits on the back with the cherries.\\nINT. LITWAK’S FAMILY FUNLAND - NIGHT\\nWe follow the trail of the train through the power cord of\\nthe Pac-Man game to the power strip.\\nTUNNEL TO GAME CENTRAL STATION\\nThe characters hop off the cart and make their way into...\\nGAME CENTRAL STATION\\n...a huge open concourse full of VIDEO GAME CHARACTERS\\nbustling about.\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\nGRAND CENTRAL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\\nLadies and gentlemen, please do not\\nleave personal items unattended.\\nUnattended items will be \\nconfiscated.

Proceed.\\nAs Ralph walks through the console. People move out of his\\nway and whisper things like, “Bad Guy.” “Watch out.”\\n\\nANGEL KID :\\n(whispering)\\nBad guy coming!\\nHe passes a screen displaying a PSA video narrated by Sonic.\\n\\nSONIC :\\nIf you leave your game, stay safe.\\nStay alert. And whatever you\\ndo...don’t die. Because if you die \\noutside your own game...you don’t \\nregenerate. Ever.

Ralph looks up just as “WE LOVE YOU FELIX”\\nfireworks burst over the Niceland apartments. Huh?\\nHe digs two bottles out of the trash. He uses them as\\nbinoculars, and aims them at the penthouse...\\nTHROUGH BINOCULARS: it’s a rockin’ party.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nHappy thirtieth anniversary?\\nThey’re having a party without me?\\nThere are ice sculptures and dancing and a giant buffet\\ntable. Eating his way across the table is PAC-MAN.\\nRALPH (CONT’D)\\nPac-Man! They invited Pac-Man? That\\ncherry-chasing, dot-muncher isn’t \\neven part of this game!\\nHe slams the bottles down.

Felix needs to be on the\\nroof, because he’s about to get his\\nmedal.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nWell, then how about we just take\\nthat medal and give it to Ralph for\\nonce.

That’s why I have to\\nget Ralph home, or the same thing’s\\ngonna happen to my game.\\nDING! DING! The entire tree is double stripe. It blinks.\\nFELIX (CONT’D) \\nHuh?\\nThe tree disappears.

We’re gonna drown here!\\n\\nCALHOUN :\\nStop thrashing! Stop moving--\\nyou’re making us sink faster!\\nHe’s still panicking. Calhoun slaps him in the face.\\nCALHOUN (CONT’D)\\nGet a hold of yourself.\\nHe looks at her, shocked. Suddenly they hear GIGGLING. They\\nlook up to see Laffy Taffy vines hanging from a tree. As the\\nvines giggle, they stretch and lower towards them.\\n\\nFELIX :\\nThose vines. They’re Laffy Taffy. \\nThey’re attracted to whatever makes\\nthem laugh.

He grabs hold, then\\npulls her into his arms.\\nFELIX (CONT’D)\\nHold on tight, m’lady.\\nThe vine sweeps them up and out of the quicksand. The world\\nslows down. Music swells. Calhoun looks up at Felix. For some\\nreason he looks strong-jawed and heroic. He smiles down on\\nher. Man, she’s beautiful. There’s a real chemistry between \\nthem. They arrive on the tree branch.\\nCalhoun notices that the Laffy Taffy are singing in a Disneyesque \\nchoir and have formed a heart shape around them.

Neither one of us is \\ngetting what we want.\\nRalph stomps his foot. BOOM!

Yeah, that’s still \\nthe horn.\\n\\nVANELLOPE :\\nI like the horn.\\n\\nRALPH :\\nListen, we got work to do!\\n\\nVANELLOPE :\\nOkay!\\nShe stops, focuses on him.

Perfect.\\n\\nPage 79/120\\n\\n\\x0cRALPH :\\nI got that medal in the bag.\\nShe then aims for a giant jump...takes flight and....GLITCH!\\nHer kart glitches about in the air, out of control.

Bugs\\nattack. He punches them out of his way, sways, almost falls.\\nRalph reaches the top of Diet Cola Mountain and jumps off the\\nhover board. The crater’s center is like petrified Mentos \\n(think Giant’s Causeway). Ralph punches it with all of his \\nmight.

He grabs onto it \\nand hugs it to his chest.\\nRALPH (CONT'D)\\nThere’s no one I’d rather be than \\nme.\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\n107\\nHe slams his fists down on the volcano’s Mentos crater. It \\ncracks all around.\\nIN DIET-COLA MOUNTAIN: The stalactite falls towards the \\nbroiling hot diet cola. Ralph falls with it. This is it.\\nSuddenly, Vanellope rides up the side ramp in a kart. She\\nmakes the big jump and catches Ralph on the hood of her kart.\\nRALPH (CONT’D) \\nKid?\\n\\nVANELLOPE :\\nDon’t worry, I got it under \\ncontrol!\\nShe bounces off the stalactite, and glitches through the\\nother side of the mountain, just as the mountain erupts.\\nThe cy-bugs instinctively stop fighting. They turn and fly\\ntowards the geyser's bright light. ZAP! ZAP! ZAP!\\nUp in the air, Turbo looks around at the other bugs.\\n\\nKC TURBO BUG:\\nYou fools!

I love chocolate.\\nFelix and Calhoun see it all from the rainbow.\\n\\nPage 113/120\\n\\n\\x0cFELIX :\\nYou did it, Ralph! You did it,\\nbrother!\\nHe laughs for joy. Felix hops up and gives Calhoun an 8-bitkiss \\non her cheek. A little ten-point heart rises up. She\\nlooks at him like she’s going to kill him. Yanks him up by\\nWRECK-IT RALPH\\n108\\nhis collars and slams her lips on his. It’s worth ten \\nthousand points.\\n\\nDISSOLVE TO:\\nEXT.
