      "Al That was when the icecaps had melted because of the greenhouse gases... ...and the oceans had drowned cities... ...along all the shorelines of the world. Amsterdam, Venice, New York... ...forever lost. Millions of people were displaced. Climate became chaotic. Hundreds of millions of people starved in poorer countries. A high degree of prosperity survived when the developed world... ...introduced sanctions to license pregnancies... ...which was why robots, who did not consume resources... ...beyond those of their first manufacture... ...were so essential an economic link... ...in the chain mail of society. To create an artificial being has been man's dream... ...since the birth of science. Not merely from the modern age when our forebears created... ...the first thinking machines, primitive ones that played chess. How far we have come. The artificial being is a reality, a perfect simulacrum... ...articulated in limb, articulate in speech... ...and not lacking in human response. And even pain-memory response. How did that make you feel? Angry? Shocked? I don't understand. - What did I do to your feelings? You did it to my hand. All right. There's the rub. Undress. At Cybertronics, the artificial being has reached its highest form. The universally adapted Mecha... ...the basis for hundreds of models serving humans... ...in all the multiplicity of daily life. That's far enough. But we have no reason to congratulate ourselves. We are rightly proud of it. But what does it amount to? Sheila, open. A sensory toy... ...with intelligent behavioral circuits... ...using neurone-sequencing technology... ...as old as I am. I believe that my work on mapping the impulse pathways in a neurone... ...can enable us to construct... ...a Mecha of a qualitatively different order. I propose... ...that we build a robot... ...who can love. Love? But we ship thousands of lover-models every month. Of course. You're your own best customer, Syatyoo-Sama. Quality control is very important. Tell me, what is love? Love is first widening my eyes... ...quickening my breathing, warming my skin and... And so on, exactly so. Thank you, Sheila. I wasn't referring to sensuality simulators. The word that I used was 'love.' Like the love of a child for its parents. I propose that we build a robot-child who can love. A robot-child who will genuinely love the parent it imprints on... ...with a love that never ends. A child-substitute Mecha? But a Mecha with a mind, with neuronal feedback. I'm suggesting that love will be the key... ...by which they acquire a subconscious never before achieved. An inner world of metaphor, of intuition... ...of self-motivated reasoning, of dreams. A robot that dreams? How exactly do we pull this off? It occurs to me... ...with all this animus existing against Mechas today... ...it isn't just creating a robot who can love. But isn't the real conundrum, can a human love them back? Ours will be a perfect child, always loving, never ill, never changing. With all the childless couples yearning for a license... ...our Mecha will open up a new market and fill a great human need. But you haven't answered my question. If a robot could genuinely love a person... ...what responsibility does that person hold toward that Mecha in return? It's a moral question, isn't it? - The oldest one of all. But in the beginning, didn't God create Adam to love him? Twenty months later KRYOGENICS 'The baby was born as the first leaves of autumn fell. A baby boy. And Marian's wish came true. The boy had white hair. He was baptized Martin, after his grandfather.' Dr. Frazier, good to see you. There was an article in the Journal of Chinese Medicine. Hello, Monica. They talked about virus locators. Did you read it? I can still hear you. I'm worried about her. - I know. She feels that she should mourn the death of your son. After five years, you feel you should mourn too. But medicine says mourning is inappropriate. Martin is pending. Pending. So all her grief goes undigested. Henry, your son may be beyond our science. But it's your wife who can still be reached. The screening process was tougher than building the prototype. Of our 2000 employees, only a few met your requirements. Initiate. Employment record, quality of lifestyle. Query. Internal data. Loyalty to the firm, and in this individual's case... ...a family tragedy that may qualify him above the rest. I'll see him. Henry. Don't kill me. - What are you doing? I love you. Don't kill me. The door's closed. I like your floor. I can't accept this. There is no substitute for your own child. It's not too late to take him back. - What were you thinking? I'll do whatever you want. - Do you think I can just...? I'll do whatever you want. - I don't know what to do. I'll return him to Cybertronics in the morning. It's gone. Good. I mean, Henry, did you see his face? He's so real. But he's not. - No, he's not. Inside, he's like the rest, isn't he? - 100 miles of fiber, yeah. But outside, he just looks so real... ...like he is a child. A Mecha-child. A child. The faith my company has placed on me, on us, is extraordinary. There are a few procedures to follow if you decide to keep David. If you keep him, an imprinting protocol consisting of seven words... ...needs to be spoken to David in this order here. For our own protection, this imprinting is irreversible. His love would be sealed and we'd be part of him forever. Because of this, after imprinting, no Mecha-child can be resold. If a parent decides not to keep it... ...they must return it to Cybertronics for destruction. I had to sign an agreement or they wouldn't let you see David. You have to sign it too. Right here. Monica... ...don't imprint until you're entirely sure. Silly man. Of course I'm not sure. Would you like me to sleep now? Good idea. Good idea. Monica? Well, it's late, you know. It's after 9. How late do they let you stay up? I can never go to sleep. But I can lay quietly and not make a peep. Those pajamas will fit. We'll check on you in the morning. Dress me? I'm gonna say good night while you boys be boys. Raise your arms. Is it a game? - Yes. Hide-and-seek. I found you. That's your room. Just go and play. I found you. Out. Out. Get out of here. And close the goddamn door. IMPRINTING PROTOCOL These words permitted by law Clear and in the order Is it a game? Now, I'm gonna read some words. They won't make any sense, but I want you to listen to them anyway. And look at me all the time. Can you do that? Yes, Monica. Can you feel my hand on the back of your neck? Yes. Does any of this hurt? - No. Okay, now... ...look at me. Ready? Cirrus. Socrates. Particle. Decibel. Hurricane. Dolphin. Tulip. Monica. David. Monica. All right. I wonder if I did that right. What were those words for, Mommy? What did you call me? Mommy. Who am l, David? You are my mommy. You smell lovely. I love it when you wear this stuff. Will you love me when it's all gone? - No. Stop it. We can marry again and begin with a scent that's not in short supply. Come on, we're late. Hello, David. - Hello, Henry. Walk us out, sweetheart. Come on. My shoe. Your tie. You're hopeless. - I'm helpless. He made our bed. He's just trying so hard. He's trying to please me. He has a way with my coffee. It's creepy. You never hear him coming. He is only a child. - He's a toy. He's a gift. From you. David, when we leave, the doors will go smart... ...so you can't leave your room, but if you'd like... I put too much on. - Do I smell lovely? Oh, God, no. Mommy? Will you die? Well, one day, David, yes, I will. I'll be alone. Don't worry yourself so. How long will you live? For ages. For 50 years. I love you, Mommy. I hope you never die. Never. Yes. Darling. We're becoming unfashionably, unreasonably late. Hello? This belonged to Martin, my son. His name is Teddy. Teddy, this is David. Hello, Teddy. - Hello, David. Teddy is a supertoy. I know you'll take good care of each other. I am not a toy. Henry. Sorry. - What were you doing? I'll tell you in the car. Come on. Is 50 years a long time? I don't think so. David, I'll get it. Hand it to me. - Look what I can do. Hello. Yes? Mrs. Swinton, could you hold? I have an urgent call. Yes, I will. David, I need the phone now. Monica? Can you hear me? Let the phone talk now. - Pick up the phone, Monica. Run along, play with Teddy. - Oh, my God, Moni... Hello, Henry, what is it? What? When? Oh, God. David. The most wonderful thing in the whole world has happened. This is Martin. This is my son. Martin, no. We'll have a contest to see who he comes to first. Come here, Teddy. Come here. Teddy. Come here. You call him too. - Come here, Teddy. Come on. Teddy. - Come here, boy. Come here. Come on, Teddy. - Come here, Teddy. Teddy, come. - Come here, Teddy. Come here, Teddy. - Come, Teddy. Come. Mommy. Mommy. Are they torturing you, Teddy? He used to be a supertoy, but... ...now he's old and stupid. You want him? Yes, please. Now you're the new supertoy. What stuff can you do? Can you do power stuff, like walk on the ceiling or the walls? Anti-gravity, like float or fly? Can you? No, because I'm real. Can you break this? I better not. These things, they do look better in pieces. They do. I can't. Stand up. Look, they made you bigger than me. - Who did? They did. The dollmakers. They made you taller. Why don't you look like one? Like one? You're not cute like a doll. You just look like someone's ordinary kid. When's your birthday? I never had a birthday. When were you first built? When's your 'build-day'? I don't remember. Okay, what's the first thing you can remember? A bird. What sort of bird? A bird with big wings... ...and feathers sticking up from the bottom. Can you draw it? Yes. That looks like a peacock. Can you say peacock? Peacock. Can you say pee? - Pee. Now say that two times fast. Okay. Then you gotta put the green ones... Read to us? Let's see. Oh, yeah. David's going to love it. 'The Showman went into the kitchen... ...where the sheep for supper... ...was roasting on the spit in the furnace. When he saw there was not enough wood... ...he called Harlequin and Punchinello and said: 'Bring me Pinocchio. He is hanging on a nail. He is made of dry wood and will make a nice fire for my roast.' ' 'Pinocchio worked until midnight. And instead of making eight baskets, he made 16. Then he went to bed and fell asleep. As he slept, he dreamt he saw the fairy, lovely and smiling... ...who gave him a kiss, saying: 'Brave Pinocchio... ...in return for your good heart, I forgive all your past misdeeds. Be good in future, and you will be happy.' Then the dream ended and Pinocchio awoke, full of amazement. You can imagine how astonished he was when he saw... ...that he was no longer a puppet... ...but a real boy, just like other boys.' Josephine has taken a leave of absence. Oh, my God. Well, I saw that coming. How? They were fabulous together. - Come on. She was miserable. He never said they were miserable. - That's because... Is that because of the cutbacks? - No idea. They don't tell me. Do they have a weight problem? - So do I. You do not. That is ridiculous. I don't know. There's something about inner beauty that... You will break. That is ridiculous. - Exactly. Work has become so silly. - I know what you're talking about. Does he eat? - I'm not sure. You're not supposed to do that. - What are you doing? Martin, put the fork down. - Stop, David. Will you stop? Martin, you're provoking him. Stop it. Stop it. - The two of you, stop. Stop it now. Stop it. David, stop it. There's sputum in the code lockers. - Smell that garlic. We should throw in a chest mint. Can you locate the surface? - Don't touch the merchandise. It's all swamp in here. - You made a mess of yourself. Spinach is for rabbits, people and Popeye. Not robo-boys. Try to insert yourself. Through the pantry, the lower shelves. It's okay, Mommy. It doesn't hurt. Deactivators are all shut down on the left side. Monica. - No. I have to... That's not all of it. That's not all of it. If you do something really, really, really special for me... ...a special mission... ...then I'll go tell Mommy... ...I love you. And then she'll love you too. What shall I do? You have to promise, and then I'll tell you. You have to tell me, and then I'll promise. I want a lock of Mommy's hair. I'll share it with you. And if you had it and wore it... ...she might love you even more. Like the princess in the movie we saw. When she had the prince's hair in her necklace thing... ...he loved her. We can ask her. No, it has to be a secret mission. Sneak into Mommy's bedroom in the middle of the night... ...and chop it off. I can't, Martin. I'm not allowed. You promised. You said, 'Tell me, and then I'll promise.' Didn't you? David. Why did you do that? Why did you do that?. Talk to me. Goddamn it, talk to me. Why did you do that? You're hurting him. You'll break him. Henry... ...I wanted Mommy to love me... ...more. Oh, my God. - What? I think I cut my eye. I think it's bleeding. Come on, watch it. It's normal for boys to feel jealous and competitive. Martin's been home a month. Brothers normally challenge each other. He was playing a game, he made a mistake. He's practically human. Not holding the knife. - Scissors. It was a weapon. Why do you think he'd harm me? - We don't know the answer. How is he worth the risk to you, to Martin, to our family? I won't let you take him back. - Think about this. If he was created to love, then we can assume he can hate. And if pushed to those extremes, what is he capable of? Happy birthday, Martin. I made this for you. Is this your little brother? - Technically, no. He's Mecha. - What's Mecha? We're 'org-anic'... ...you're 'mecha-anical.' Orga, Mecha. Orga, Mecha. Todd, stop. I didn't know they even made kids. Can you pee? I cannot. - Let's see what you can't pee with. Guys, come on. Touch it. It feels so real. That's creepy. It feels so real. - That is too real. Mecha-real. Does he have DAS? DAS what? - Das ist gut. Damage Avoidance System. DAS. It's a pain-alert system. Our serving man has it. It's so they don't go picking up fire with their hands. Watch. Watch this. I'm not gonna cut you. This won't hurt. I'm not gonna cut your skin. Tell me when you feel it. Keep me safe, Martin. - Let me go. Keep me safe, Martin. - Let me go. Mom. Mom. Henry. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he's not breathing. Take a breath. Cough it up. That's a great boy. Thank God. - Call Frazier. Get him out of the sun. Hey, David? - Mommy. I need to speak to you for a minute, okay? Okay. TEDDY HELPS ME WRITING. I LIKE YOU AND TEDDY. I LIKE YOU AND HENRY AND THE SUN SHINES. I'M REALLY OUR SON AND I HATE TEDDY. I'M YOURBOY AND MARTIN TOO, BUT NOT TEDDY. These are beautiful. Thank you. I was thinking that we could go for a drive tomorrow in the country. You and me. What do you say? And Teddy? - Yeah, and Teddy. Thank you, Mommy. Thank you so much. Tomorrow's gonna be just for us, okay? Where are we going? Someplace nice? Are those happy tears? What's for dinner tonight? You know you don't eat. - Yes. But I like sitting at the table. David? David, I want... David, listen. Listen to me. David, listen. You won't understand the reasons... ...but I have to leave you here. Is it a game? No. When will you come back for me? I'm not. You'll have to be here by yourself. Alone? With Teddy. No. No, no, no. No, Mommy, please. No, no. Please, Mommy. - They would destroy you, David. I'm sorry I broke myself, I'm sorry I cut your hair... ...and I'm sorry I hurt Martin... I have to go. I have to go. Stop it. Stop it. I have to go now. - Mommy, don't. Mommy. If Pinocchio became real and I become real, can I come home? That's a story. - But a story tells what happens. Stories are not real. You're not real. Now, look. Take this, all right? Take this. Don't let anyone see how much it is. Look. Don't go that way. Go anywhere but that way or they'll catch you. Don't ever let them catch you. Stay away from Flesh Fairs, away from where there are lots of people. Stay away from all people. Only others like you, only Mecha are safe. Why do you want to leave me? Why? I'm sorry I'm not real. If you let me, I'll be so real for you. Let go. Let go, David. Let go. I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the world. I'm afraid. Of me? - Yes. That I will hurt you? Yes. I think... ...you're afraid of letting go. I think you're afraid of happiness. And this is starting to excite me. Are you afraid of seeing the stars... ...Patricia? I can show you how to reach them. I'm afraid of what you've got under there. May I see what it looks like first? Is this your first time... ...with something like me? I've never been with Mecha. That makes two of us. I'm afraid it will hurt. Patricia... ...once you've had a lover-robot... ...you'll never want a real man... ...again. Are these the wounds of passion? Do you hear that music? You... ...are a goddess... ...Patricia. You wind me up inside. But you deserve much better in your life. You deserve... ...me. Samantha Bevins Hey, Joe, what do you know? - Jane, how's the game? Hey, Joe, what do you know? - Hello. Place a DND on room 102. Sure thing. There you are. Oh, Joe. When you're done, crack your collar, show off your operating license. The Flesh Fair is in Barn Creek and the hounds are out hunting for strays. Good thing I ran into you. Thanks. - Sure thing. Mustn't keep a lady waiting. Miss Bevins. It's Joe. At your service. I've been counting the seconds since last we met. Have you been crying, Samantha? I found a tear. Hey, Joe, what do you know? How many seconds has it been... ...the last time you two were together? 255,133. Goodbye, Sam. And never forget: You killed me first. I'm in bad trouble. If I am a real boy... ...then I can go back. And she will love me then. How? The Blue Fairy made Pinocchio into a real boy. She can make me into a real boy. I must find her. I must become real. There must be someone in the whole world who knows where she lives. Moon on the rise. It's the Flesh Fair. They destroy us on-stage. I've been there. What do we do? We run now. Any old iron. Any old iron. Any old iron. Any old iron. Expel your Mecha. Purge yourselves of artificiality. Let some Mecha loose to run. Any old unlicensed iron down there? Hey, you see that? Could be a human thing. No, he's scanning cold. No expiration date, no I.D. What's a new model doing loose? - It's a late-generation lover-Mecha. That's a relief from all this antique iron. Sure he's not a man? I don't want another Trenton incident. He's a free-range Mecha running hot. Reel him in. Sic the hounds on the rest. Shake down shantytown. What's your name? My name is David. Hello, David. How old are you? I don't know. You need someone to take care of you? Would you like a nanny? I have many good references. Do you know where the Blue Fairy lives? Let out the line. Steady your drift. Open the lower hold. Don't be afraid, David. I'll break, David. Hello. Anybody lose this? Hello. This your dog? Take it to lost and found. Lost and found. FLASH FAIR CELEBRATION OF LIFE Do you know David? - Where's the 'off' switch? Where's David? Can you help me find David? I have to find David. Are you taking me to David? LOST AND FOUND Could you shoot me over the propeller? I don't need to go through it. I changed my mind. Gentlemen, start your engines. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. What about us? What about us? We are alive... ...and this is a celebration of life. And this is commitment... ...to a truly human future. What's your name? - Hello, Teddy. Hello, David. Take it. Take it. Biker hounds rolling. - Cue biker hound. Papa. - Amanda, go outside. It's smoky here. There's a boy in the cage. What did you say? - There's a boy in the cage. A boy? - A real boy. He's stuck in the cage. In the pen, honey? - In the jail place. Crowd reaction... - We got a remote near the pigpen? Bring it up. Let me see what she's talking about. What are you looking for? - She says she saw a boy in there. How do you know about this? - The bear told me. I told her. Would you be so kind and shut down my pain receivers? Why is this happening? History repeats itself. It's the rite of blood and electricity. When the opportunities avail themselves, they pick away at us... ...cutting back our numbers so they can maintain numerical superiority. My time, is it up already? Goodbye, everyone. Keep me safe, keep me safe. - Not yet. They just want him. Keep me safe, keep me safe, keep me safe. Security. Do you have any reports of any missing kids, any missing children? All right, thanks. How'd you get in there? Boy. You, boy. What's your name? I won't bite you. Come over where I can see you. I won't hurt you. I just need to see. You're a machine. - I'm a boy. Is he a toy boy? My name is David. Impossible. I still work, don't I? I can work in the dark, but my lamp is broken. My lamplight will not work. I hit my lamp on a girder overhead. Goodbye, David. No one builds children. No one ever has. What would be the point? It could be a custom job. Some rich guy's pretend child. I'm a custom job. 75 years ago, I was Time magazine's Mecha of the Year. No, this work is first-rate. A lot of love went into him. David? You are one of a kind, you know that? Who made you? - My mommy made me. One of those built to aspire to the human condition. Who is your maker? Serve U.S., E.Z. Living, Robiville? Simulit City Center, Cybertronics? - Monica is my mommy. Can I speak with you for a moment? You're thinking about not showing him? Something this original you don't toss out. Originality without purpose is useless. If money is your purpose, here's your refund. My compliments. What'll you do with him? - Put him where he belongs. In show business. It was certainly my good fortune, running into you. Let go of him. Let go. - I'm trying. Don't let go. Keep me safe. - Suit yourselves. Johnson-Johnson. Johnson-Johnson. Johnson-Johnson. Ladies and gentlemen... ...boys and girls and children of all ages. What will they think of next? See here. A bitty-bot, a Tinkertoy, a living doll. We all know why they made him. To steal your hearts, to replace your children. This is the latest of their insults to human dignity. And in their grand scheme to phase out God's children... ...meet the next generation of child... ...designed to do just that. Do not be fooled... ...by the artistry of this creation. No doubt there was talent in its crafting. Yet, with the very first strike, you will see the big lie... ...come apart before your very eyes. Don't burn me. Don't burn me. I'm not Pinocchio. Don't make me die. I'm David. I'm David. Mecha don't plead for their lives. Who is that? He looks like a boy. Built like a boy to disarm us. See how they try to imitate our emotions now. Whatever performance this Sim puts on, remember... ...we are only demolishing artificiality. Let he who is without Sim... ...cast the first stone. He's just a boy. Johnson, you're a monster. Get him out before they tear this place apart. IN LOVING MEMORY OF DAVID We found him. - Where? A Flesh Fair outside Haddonfield. - Is he alive? Yes. He's in one piece. I see the moon. Is it real? - I don't know, David. Is it coming? I can't tell yet. Let's not walk this way. Where are we going? - This way now. Are you in trouble? Have you run away? My mommy told me to run away. - Why? I guess because Henry didn't like me. - Why was that? Martin came home. - And who is he? Martin is Mommy and Henry's real son. After I find the Blue Fairy, then I can go home. Mommy will love a real boy. The Blue Fairy will make me into one. Is Blue Fairy Mecha, Orga, man or woman? Woman. Woman? I know women. They sometimes ask for me by name. I know all about women. About as much as there is to know. No two are ever alike. And after they've met me, no two... ...are ever the same. And I know where they can be found. Where? - Rouge City. Across the Delaware. Too far for our feet. We'll need help to get there. And it is not without peril. We will have to journey... ...towards the moon. Are there many women in Rouge City? As there are stars at night. - How do we find just one? We will ask Dr. Know. There is nothing he doesn't. Exactly what name do you give this woman? She is just Blue Fairy. Blue Fairy. In the world of Orga, blue is the color of melancholy. Yet the services I provide will put a blush back on anyone's cheek. I will change the color of your fairy for you. She will scream out: 'Oh, yes. Oh, God. Oh, yes. Oh, God. Oh, God.' She'll make you a real boy, I'll make her a real woman... ...and all will be right... ...because you held my hand and saved my brain... ...so that once again my customers may ask for me by name: 'Gigolo Joe, what do you know?' Why do you do that? That's just what I do. Now follow me and don't fall behind. All roads lead to Rouge. Don't they say that, hey? Don't they just? There are girls just like me. We are the guiltless pleasures of the lonely human. You won't get us pregnant or have us to supper. We work under you, we work on you and we work for you. Man made us better at what we do than was ever humanly possible. If you could manage us a lift to Rouge City, all this... ...and much, much more... ...can be yours. Get in. Say 'ah.' Over there is Here Kitty Kitty... ...where the agency held my tryouts when I was made new. That's Tails. Very hoity-toity. I've yet to be asked to perform there. Only sunrise gents and sunset ladies. Sierra Class robots. Can't even speak English. All made in Sweden. Couldn't tell a joke from a poke. There's Mildred. I have to show you inside Mildred. Are you her? That's Our Lady of the Immaculate Heart. Those who made us look for those who made them. They go in, fold their hands, sing songs... ...and when they come out, it's me they find. I've picked up a lot of business on this spot. But, Joe, where's Blue Fairy? That's what we'll find out when we ask Dr. Know. That's where everyone goes who needs to know. Meet the good doctor. ASK ME ANYTHING Starving minds, welcome to Dr. Know... ...where fast food for thought is served all day... ...in 40,000 locations nationwide. Ask Dr. Know. There's nothing I don't. Tell me where I can find the Blue Fairy. Question me, you pay the fee. Two for five, you get one free. Two questions cost five Newbucks with a third question on the house. In this day and age, nothing costs more than information. That's it. - Ten Newbucks and a 10 copper... ...comes to seven questions. That should be enough. He's a smooth operator. He'll press our limits, but try we must. Greetings. On offer, fact or fiction. Literacy range from primal to postdoctoral. From fairy tale to religious. Who's who or where's where. Or flat fact. Flat fact? - Thank you for question one. A term demanding an equal answer... That shouldn't count. That wasn't my question. You must not raise your voice up at the end of the sentence. Flat fact. - You have six more questions. Where is Blue Fairy? In the garden. Vascostylis Blue Fairy. Blooms twice annually with bright, blue flowers. A hybrid between Ascola meda Arnold. Five more questions. Who is Blue Fairy? Are you sad, lonely, looking for a friend? Blue Fairy Escort Service will find a mate for you. You have four more questions. Joe. Try 'fairy tale.' New category. A fairy's tale. No. Fairy tale. No. Fairy tale. What is Blue Fairy? Pinocchio, by Carlo Collodi. 'There was a rustling as a flapping of wings... ...and a falcon flew to the windowsill. 'What are your orders, beautiful fairy?' ' That's her. 'You know that the child with blue hair... ...was the good-hearted fairy... ...who had lived in that wood for more than a thousand... ' That's her. It was an example of her. But we're getting closer. But if a fairy tale is real, then wouldn't it be fact? A flat fact? Say no more. New category, please. Combine... ...fact with... ...fairy tale. Now... ...ask him again. How... ...can the Blue Fairy... ...make... ...a robot... ...into a real, live boy? Come away O human child To the waters and the wild With a fairy hand in hand For the world's more full of weeping Than you can understand Your quest will be perilous, yet the reward is beyond price. In his book, How Can a Robot Become Human?... ...Professor Allen Hobby writes of that which transforms Mecha into Orga. How do I find her? Discovery is quite possible. Our Blue Fairy does exist in one place and in one place only. At the end of the world where the lions weep. Here is the place dreams are born. Many a Mecha has gone to the end of the world, never to come back. That is why they call the end of the world 'Man-hattan.' And that's why we must go there. Wait. What if the Blue Fairy isn't real at all? What if she's magic? The supernatural unites the universe. Only Orga believe what cannot be seen. It's what separates our species. What if she's an electronic parasite... ...that haunts artificial intelligence? They hate us, you know. The humans. They'll stop at nothing. My mommy doesn't hate me. Because I'm special and unique. Because there's never been anyone like me before, ever. When I am real... ...Mommy will read to me and tuck me in my bed... ...and listen to me and cuddle with me... ...and tell me every day 100 times that she loves me. She loves what you do for her... ...as my customers love what it is I do for them. But she does not love you, David. She cannot love you. You are neither flesh nor blood. You are not a dog or a cat or a canary. You were designed and built specific like the rest of us. You are alone now because they tired of you... ...or replaced you... ...or were displeased with something you said or broke. They made us too smart, too quick and too many. We suffer for their mistakes because when the end comes... ...all that will be left is us. That's why they hate us. And that's why you must stay here. With me. Goodbye, Joe. Stay back. Stay back. Let's clear this doorway, please. You're in bad trouble. Go about your business now. Let's go. Move it. Be careful, David. This is not a toy. Destination? - Man-hattan. Mecha-restricted area. Man-hattan. - Destination achieved. The lost city in the sea at the end of the world. 'Where the lions weep.' Turn around, Joe. We're not gonna give up yet. Turn around. Turn all the way around. Professor Hobby? Professor Hobby? Come away O human child To the waters and the wild With a fairy hand in hand For the world's more full of weeping Than you can understand Professor Hobby? Professor Hobby? Hello? Hello. Is this the place they make you real? This is the place they make you read. Are you real? I guess. Are you me? I'm David. - You're not. Yes, I am. I'm David. So am I. Hello, David. Can you read? Can you sit down and we can read together? Let's be friends. You can't have her. I can't hear you. She's mine. And I'm the only one. I'm David. I'm David. I'm David. I'm special. I'm unique. I'm David. You can't have her. Yes, you are David. Professor Hobby? Yes, David. I've been waiting for you. Dr. Know told me you'd be here. Is Blue Fairy here too? I first heard of your Blue Fairy from Monica. What could the Blue Fairy do for you? - Make me a real boy. But you are a real boy. As real as I've ever made, which would make me your Blue Fairy. You're not her. Dr. Know said she'd be at the lost city in the sea... That's what Dr. Know needed to know to get you to come home to us. And it's the only time we intervened. The only help that we gave him... ...to give to you... ...so you could find your way home to us. Until you, robots didn't dream... ...robots didn't desire unless we told them what to want. Do you have any idea what a success story you've become? You found a fairy tale, and inspired by love, fueled by desire... ...you set out to make her real. Most remarkable of all, no one taught you how. We lost you for a while. When you were found, we had a simple test. Where would your self-motivated reasoning take you? To conclude that Blue Fairy... ...is a human flaw, to wish for things that don't exist... ...or to the greatest human gift... ...the ability to chase down our dreams? And that is something no machine has ever done until you. I thought I was one of a kind. My son was one of a kind. You are the first of a kind. My brain is falling out. Would you like to meet your real mothers and fathers? The team is anxious to talk to you. I want you to wait here. I'll gather them up. We want to hear everything about your adventures. We want to thank you... ...and tell you what's in store for you next. AT LAST - A LOVE YOUR OWN DAVID Mommy. I saw it, Joe. I saw it. The place where she lives. She's down there. She is? - She's waiting for me. We have to go. When you become a real boy, remember me to the ladies when you grow up. Goodbye, Joe. - Goodbye, David. I am. I was. David, please be careful. The Blue Fairy's all right. - What happened? I don't know. - We are in a cage. Blue Fairy? Please. Please, please, make me into a real, live boy. Please. Blue Fairy? Please. Please... ...make me real. Blue Fairy, please. Please make me real. Please make me a real boy. Please, Blue Fairy. Make me into a real boy. Please... And David continued to pray to the Blue Fairy... ...she who smiled softly forever. She who welcomed forever. Eventually, the floodlights died... ...but David could still see her, palely, by day. And he still addressed her, in hope. He prayed until all the sea anemones had shriveled and died... ...as the ocean froze... ...and the ice encased the amphibicopter and the Blue Fairy... ...locking them together where he could see her... ...a blue ghost in ice. Always there. Always smiling. Always awaiting him. Eventually, he never moved at all... ...but his eyes always stayed open... ...staring ahead forever all through the darkness of each night... ...and the next day... ...and the next day... Thus, 2000 years passed by. This machine was trapped under the wreckage before freezing Therefore, these robots are originals. They knew living people. Teddy, we're home. Mommy? Mommy. We're home. Where are you? David. David. You have been searching for me, haven't you? For my whole life. And what, after all this time, have you come to ask me? I have a wish to make. - And what is your wish? Please make me a real boy... ...so my mommy will love me and let me stay with her. David, I will do anything that is possible... ...but I cannot make you a real boy. Where am I? This looks like my house, but it is different. Yes, it is different. But it's also your home. We read your mind and it's all here. There's nothing too small that you didn't store for us to remember. We so want you to be happy. You are so important to us, David. You are unique in all the world. Will Mommy be coming home soon? Is she out shopping with Martin now? David, she can never come home... ...because 2000 years have passed... ...and she is no longer living. Dearest David, when you are lonely... ...we can bring back other people from your time in the past. If you can bring back other people... ...why can't you bring back her?. We can only bring back people whose bodies we dig up from the ice. We need some physical sample of the person... ...like a bone or a fingernail. David. Yes, Teddy? Do you remember when you cut some of Mommy's hair? Henry shook me. And you dropped her hair? I know. Now you can bring her back... ...can't you? Give him what he wants. Dearest David, your wish is my command. Hey, Joe, what do you know? I often felt a sort of envy of humans... ...of that thing they called spirit. Humans created a million explanations of the meaning of life... ...in art, poetry, mathematical formulas. Certainly they must be the key to the meaning of existence. But human beings no longer existed. So we began a project... ...that would make it possible to re-create a person, long dead... ...from the DNA in a fragment of bone or mummified skin. We also wondered, would it be possible... ...to retrieve a memory trace in resonance with a re-created body? And you know what we found? We found the very fabric of space-time itself... ...stored information about every event... ...which had ever occurred in the past. But the experiment was a failure. Those who were resurrected only lived through one day of renewed life. When they fell asleep on the night of their first new day... ...they died again. When they became unconscious, their very existence... ...faded away into darkness. So you see, the equations had shown... ...that once an individual space-time pathway had been used... ...it could not be reused. If we bring your mother back now... ...it will only be for one day... ...and then you will never see her again. Maybe... Maybe she will be special. Maybe she will stay. I thought this would be hard for you to understand. You were created to be so young. Maybe the one day will be like that day inside the amphibicopter. Maybe it will last forever. David, you are the enduring memory... ...of the human race. The most lasting proof of their genius. We only want for your happiness. David... ...you've had so little of that. If you want for my happiness... ...then you know what you have to do. Listen. Can you hear that? The new morning has come. Go to her, David. She's just waking up this instant. I found you. I must have dozed off. - How long...? - Would you like some coffee? Just the way you like it? Yeah, I'd love a coffee. It'll wake me up. You never forget how, do you? No. I never forget. I must be a little confused. What day is it? It is...today. As the day wore on, David thought it was the happiest day of his life. All the problems seemed to have disappeared from his mommy's mind. There was no Henry, there was no Martin. There was no grief. There was only David. David was told not to explain anything... ...or she'd be frightened and everything would be spoiled. But David's journey home belonged to him. So he didn't see the harm of painting things she'd have no memory of. David had never had a birthday because he'd never been born. So they baked a cake and lit candles. Now make a wish. - It came true already. By now, the windows were beginning to dim. David drew the shades without even needing to be asked. I really ought to be tucking you in. How strange. How fascinating. I can hardly keep my eyes open. I don't know what's come over me. Such a beautiful day. I love you, David. I do love you. I have always loved you. That was the everlasting moment he had been waiting for. And the moment had passed, for Monica was sound asleep. More than merely asleep. Should he shake her, she would never rouse. So David went to sleep too. And for the first time in his life... ...he went to that place... ...where dreams are born. for STANLEY KUBRICK happy dreams\n"

SUPERIMPOSE:  \"The most beautiful thing we\\ncan experience is the mysterious.\" - Albert Einstein\\n\\nThen:  \"I do believe in spooks.  I do believe in spooks.\\nI do, I do, I do believe in spooks.\" - The Cowardly Lion\\n\\n1\\n\\nTITLES\\n\\nAbstract images begin to form.  They move beneath the\\ntitles, brilliant against the darkness, the ghost-like\\napparitions fighting a current as if caught in the\\nwhirlwind of time.\\n\\nOur IMAGE SHARPENS.  The apparitions are no longer there.\\nInstead, police tape comes INTO FOCUS, the seemingly\\nmiles of it entangled on stacks of derelict cars that\\nfill the void.  The tape dances before us, undulating to\\na macabre rhythm, floating on the nocturnal winds.  We\\nPAN.\\n\\nAn auto wrecking yard at midnight.  Empty, yet occupied.\\n\\nLight slowly INVADES the FRAME, filling in the wrecking\\nyard\\'s cavernous shadows.  A distant ROAR announces\\nitself above the SOUNDTRACK, the earth POUNDING CLAMOR\\nAMPLIFYING in with every second.\\n\\nAs if searching for its source, CAMERA PIVOTS AROUND.\\nInstantly, we find ourselves caught in the glare of\\nheadlights, and we\\'ve just enough time to make out the\\nsemi truck before it plows through the yard\\'s chain link\\ngate, shattering it like so much glass, the truck heading\\ndirectly AT CAMERA, running it over as if it weren\\'t\\nthere.\\n\\n2\\n\\nEXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT\\n\\nBOOMING UP and OVER the fence, the yard is a veritable\\nmaze of old, rusted cars, piled up helter skelter, frozen\\nin time.  Broken glass, mangled engine parts, garbage and\\nlitter... along with hundreds of spent shell casings, are\\nscattered in the dirt.\\n\\nA caravan of UTILITY VEHICLES ROARS in behind the semi,\\nthe convoy making a bead for the center of the yard.\\n\\nPicking up the rear is a black Rolls-Royce Phantom II.\\n\\nAs they turn the last corner, the first thing we see are\\n\"unearthly\" flares.  Dozens of them, bright as hell,\\nlighting up the middle of the graveyard.\\n\\nThe CARS come SKIDDING to a stop.  Dust swirls.\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c3\\n\\nEXT.

So I \\nwandered around until it started to rain, then took a subway \\nback to the friend\\'s house and hung out there for four or \\nfive days.  Saw the changing of the guards at Buckingham \\nPalace.  Ate a grapefruit next to the Thames River, which \\nreminded me a lot of the cover of that Pink Floyd album.  \\nWrote my mom a postcard I never sent.  Bought some speed from \\nan Italian guy I bumped into.  Smoked a lot of hash that had \\ntoo much tobacco in it.  Took a ferry and then a bus to \\nDingle, Ireland where I drank too much Guiness Stout after \\neating spaghetti and threw it all up in front of a movie \\ntheater just as people were walking out.  Stayed in a hostel \\nbut the assholes that worked there made me collect peat moss \\nfor the fire so I got a room in a bed-and-breakfast.  Went to \\nDublin.

The museums \\nwere cool, I guess.  Lots of Van Goghs and the Vermeers were \\nintense.  Wandered around, bought a lot of pastries, ate some \\nintense waffles.  The Dutch all know English so I didn\\'t have \\nto speak any Dutch, which was a relief.  Wanted to rent a car \\nbut couldn\\'t.  The people I was staying with had bikes \\nthough, so I went biking one day and I saw a lot of cows and \\ngeese and canals.  I pulled off to the side of the road, got \\nstoned and fell asleep, woke up, wrote a little, took some \\nacid, made a few drawings, and then went to the red light \\ndistrict in Den Haag, because I heard the whores are cleaner \\nand better looking than the whores in Amsterdam -- which they \\nwere.  I fucked one so hard that I skinned my knees.  Ate \\nlunch at a Burger King, which was better and no more \\nexpensive than the States.  Stayed in the Amsterdam Youth \\nHostel where there were some cool German guys who spoke \\nbetter English than I do.  We bought some coke and I cruised \\nthe red light district until I found a brunette with big tits \\nthat reminds me of KJ.  I gave her a hundred Guilders.  She \\nworked me up, mounted me, put on a good show, and in the end \\nshe pulled me out and I came between her tits -- even though \\nI’m wearing a rubber.  Afterward we made small talk about \\nAIDS, her Moroccan pimp, and herself.  I wake to the sound of \\na wino singing.  It is eight AM and hot as blazes.  Had a \\nbeer and then headed South to Paris.  Climbed the Eifel Tower \\nwith this Canadian guy named Tim for only seven Francs \\nbecause the ticket machine was broke.  Got the hang of the \\nSubways.  Told Tim to get lost.  Met a French girl who’s \\ngoing to Camden.  I think she gave me mono.  Went to Pamplona \\nfor the running of the bulls.  Never saw one bull but I \\nalmost got trampled by the crowd.  Dropped acid at the Museo \\nGala-Dalí, which was a trip.  Went to the lamest circus ever, \\na goat and two guys on unicycles.  Went to Nice and ate \\nMexican food at a place called Calexico -- or Mexicali.  Then \\nwent to Switzerland where I, ironically, couldn’t find anyone \\nwho had the time.  Took the Glacier Express to Zermatt, the \\nMatterhorn, and found out that I could ski it, which, when \\nyou’re there, you have to do -- but I didn’t have gloves so I \\nused socks instead and froze my hands.  It was slushy but \\nfun.  Ate some Sourdough bread that tasted like it was made \\nwith sour milk.  Eurail Pass’d into Italy and accidently \\nslept through Florence.  Ended up in Rome which was big and \\nhot and dirty.  It was just like L.A., but with ruins.  I \\nwent to the Vatican but couldn’t get in because I was wearing \\nshorts.  I could get into the Sistine Chapel, which now that \\nit’s been cleaned looked fake.  At the train station I met \\ntwo girls from Germany who I drank warm beer with.  They’re \\nliving for a full year on only nine dollars a day.  I tease \\nthem and then turn the couchette into a huge bed and we all \\nfuck.

I come close to fucking her \\nbut she says she can’t because she’s engaged, which is \\nbullshit.  I leave the next morning before they get up and \\ntake the ferry back to Italy.  On the train I meet some Dutch \\nguys.  We started drinking heavily.  The Dutch guys seem like \\nfags to me.  I got so drunk I couldn’t see and exchanged my \\nshirt with one of them.  In Venice I try to fart and instead \\nshit my pants.  Back in my hotel I masturbate and have a pain \\nin my groin.  That night I dream about a beautiful girl half \\nin water, stretching her lean body.  She asks me if I like it \\nand I tell her she could clean fish with it.  I wake well \\nrested, masturbate in shower, and check out.  I make my way \\nback to London and hang out in Piccadilly Circus at a comic \\nbook shop.  I meet a cute girl from Amsterdam at a Whimpys \\nwhile eating a Spicy Bean Burger.  She’s an Oreo with a \\ndiamond in her front tooth.  We get stoned and fuck at her \\nflat to Michael Jackson records and the next morning I wake \\nup talking to myself.  I have a big bump on my head from \\nflailing in my sleep.  I get my stuff and barely make my \\nplane back to the United States.  I no longer know who I am \\nand feel like the ghost of a total stranger.\\n\\nThe final image of this montage is of an American Airlines DC-\\n10 flying over the pillowy clouds of the Atlantic bound for \\nthe United States.

And now I\\'m here in space.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Yeah. <i>[Tony crosses to stand right in front of Peter]</i> Right where I don\\'t want you to be. This isn\\'t Coney Island. This isn\\'t a field trip. It\\'s a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don\\'t pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker</b>: No. I did think this through.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> You could not have possibly thought this through.\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker</b>: It\\'s just .. you can\\'t be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there\\'s no neighborhood. <i>[He waits for Tony\\'s reaction]</i> Okay. That didn\\'t really make any sense, but you know what I\\'m trying to say.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> <i>[Breaths shakily]</i> Come on. We got a situation. <i>[He leads Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.]</i> See him down there? He\\'s in trouble. What\\'s your plan? Go.\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker</b>: Um. Okay, okay... uh... <i>[Peter and the Cloak pop back upright]</i> Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, <i>Aliens</i>?\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Cloak lifts its collar in surprise.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Cut back to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange, who groans loudly.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Ebony Maw:</b> Painful aren\\'t they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...\\n</p>, <p><i>[At the \"thump\" behind him, Maw turns to see Iron Man standing there, hand repulsors ready to fire.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Ebony Maw:</b> ...Could end your friend\\'s life in an instant.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> I gotta tell you, he\\'s not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.\\n</p>, <p><b>Ebony Maw:</b> <i>[Walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him]</i> You\\'ve saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Yeah, but the kid\\'s seen more movies.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Iron Man fires a rocket from his shoulder which pierces the side of the ship to Maw\\'s right and begins to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his large objects. Dr. Strange is pulled loose of his pinnings, loses the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cape wraps around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange\\'s arm slips loose and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit\\'s metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange is still surrounded by the ship\\'s atmosphere making haste to leave.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> Yes! Wait what are those?!\\n</p>, <p><i>[Spider-Man crouches with his new spider-legs, and makes a mighty leap to pulls them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprays nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hits the floor. Ebony Maw is seen floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man lands on his new legs, retracts them, and finds the Cape \"standing\" next to him.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> Hey, we haven\\'t officially met. <i>[He offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to Dr. Strange.]</i> Cool.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Iron Man walks past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange gets to his feet and becomes en-Cloaked.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> We\\'ve gotta turn this ship around.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> No, I want to protect the stone.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Tony walks towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> <i>[Irritably]</i> And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I\\'m listening.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> For what? Nearly blasting me into space?\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Who just saved your magical ass? Me.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> I seriously don\\'t know how you fit your head into that helmet.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> Unlike everyone else in your life, I don\\'t work for you.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> And due to that fact, we\\'re now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Seriously, these two\\'s egos are a recipe for disaster.] </i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> <i>[Raises his hand]</i> I\\'m backup.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> No. You\\'re a stowaway. <i>[Waggles a finger between himself and Dr. Strange] </i>The adults are talking.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> I\\'m sorry, I\\'m confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> No. I\\'m Peter, by the way.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> Dr. Strange.\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> Oh, we\\'re using our made-up names. Um... I\\'m Spider-Man, then.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing\\'s on autopilot.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> <i>[Walks closer to Tony]</i> Can we control it? Fly us home? <i>[Tony is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away.]</i> Stark?\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Yeah?\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> Can you get us home?\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Yeah I heard you. I\\'m thinking... I\\'m not so sure we should.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don\\'t think you quite understand what\\'s at stake here.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> <i>[Stalks over to Strange]</i> No. It\\'s <i>you</i> who doesn\\'t understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for <i>six years</i> since he sent an army to New York and now he\\'s <i>back!</i> And I don\\'t know what to do. So I\\'m not so <i>sure</i> if it\\'s a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he\\'s not expecting it. So <i>I</i> say we take the fight to him. <i>Doctor</i>. Do you concur?\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> <i>[Pauses]</i> Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can\\'t, because the fate of the universe depends on it.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> Nice. Good. Moral compass. We\\'re straight. <i>[Stepping over to Peter, he formally taps each of Peter\\'s shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting.]</i> Alright, kid. You\\'re an Avenger now. <i>[He doesn\\'t look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Peter looks at Tony in disbelief, and then cycles through delight, satisfaction, pride and determination, and braces himself for what\\'s to come.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Cut to Thanos\\' mother-ship, </i>Sanctuary II, <i>which dwarfs the massive ring-ships the Black Order have been using. Gamora sits near the throne deep inside the ship. Thanos walks up, bringing a cup of food and holds it out to her.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> I thought you might be hungry.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Gamora takes it, then hurls it across the room where it bangs against Thanos\\' throne with a loud clack.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> I always hated that chair.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> So I\\'ve been told. Even so. I\\'d hoped you\\'d sit on it one day.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> You told me that too. <i>[Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.]</i> Every day. For almost twenty years.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> I was a child when you took me.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> I saved you.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> No. No. We were happy on my home planet.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I\\'m the one who stopped that. Do you know what\\'s happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It\\'s a paradise.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> Because you murdered half the planet.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> A small price to pay for salvation.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> You\\'re insane.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> Little one, it\\'s a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> You don\\'t know that!\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[Scowls as his egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] </i>I\\'m the only one who knows that. At least, I\\'m the only one with the will to act on it. <i>[He stands again and walks back to Gamora]</i> For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> I\\'m not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That\\'s why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> I\\'m sorry I disappointed you.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> I am disappointed. But not because you didn\\'t find it. <i>[Leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely]</i> But because you did. <i>[Looks at her] </i>And you <i>lied</i>.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos and Gamora stand outside a large solid door that slides open vertically as they approach, then pause as a set of inner doors made of interlacing metal slide away. Inside, we see Nebula face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> Nebula.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Gamora hurries to to Nebula\\'s left side, and we now see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart -- a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Hannibal Lecter level of brutality.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> Don\\'t do this.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> Please don\\'t do this.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos curls his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling -- causing Nebula\\'s already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She begins to scream.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> Stop. Stop it. <i>[She puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down]</i> I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos signals a nearby servant who taps on a control pad. We hear Nebula\\'s voice say, </i>\"Accessing memory files\" <i>and a sort of hologram of Gamora\\'s face shudders to life.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Memory Nebula:</b> You know what he\\'s about to do. He\\'s finally ready, and he\\'s going for the stones. All of them.\\n</p>, <p><b>Memory Gamora:</b> He can never get them all.\\n</p>, <p><b>Memory Nebula:</b> He will!\\n</p>, <p><b>Memory Gamora:</b> He can\\'t, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The memory ends.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[To Gamora, walking around behind her]</i> You\\'re strong. Me. You\\'re generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That\\'s why you\\'re so <i>bad</i> at it. <i>[His voice drips with disgust]</i> Where is the Soul Stone? <i>[He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora\\'s face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister\\'s silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stones are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister\\'s screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> Vormir! <i>[Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.]</i> The Stone is on Vormir.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[Satisfied.] </i>Show me.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Cut to the pod taking Thor, Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Groot:</b> <i>[Irritably]</i> I am Groot. (Translation: I need to tinkle.)\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Tinkle in the cup. We\\'re not looking. What\\'s there to see? What\\'s a twig? Everybody\\'s seen a twig.\\n</p>, <p><b>Groot:</b> <i>[Still irritably]</i> I am Groot. (Translation: But the cup is full.)\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> <i>[While looking out the rear portholes]</i> Tree, pour what\\'s in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> You speak Groot?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.\\n</p>, <p><b>Groot:</b> <i>[Shortly]</i> I am Groot. (Translation: How long \\'till we get there?)\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> You\\'ll know when we\\'re there. Nivadellir\\'s forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. <i>[Nostalgically]</i> It\\'s the birth place of my hammer. It\\'s truly awesome.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Rocket turns to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window, and sighs.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> <i>[To himself]</i> Okay, time to be the captain. <i>[Walks to a console near by Thor, presses two buttons]</i> So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Well, he\\'s been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> And you said your sister and your dad?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Both dead.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Still got a mom, though?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Killed by a dark elf.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> A best friend?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Stabbed through the heart.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Are you sure you\\'re up to this particular murder mission?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> <i>[Smiling widely but also trying to convince himself]</i> Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they\\'re all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I\\'m good to go.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Yeah, but this Thanos we\\'re talking about... he\\'s the toughest there is.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Well, he\\'s never fought me.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Yeah, he has!\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> He\\'s never fought me twice. And I\\'m getting a new hammer, don\\'t forget.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Better be some hammer.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> You know, I\\'m 1,500 years old. I\\'ve killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I\\'m only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> And what if you\\'re wrong?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> If I\\'m wrong then... what more could I lose?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thor sniffs and hastily wipes below his eye. He stands and seats himself at the front of the pod, beside Groot.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> <i>[Under his breath]</i> I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. <i>[Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person]</i> Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you\\'re gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. <i>[He gives Thor the eyeball.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> What\\'s this?\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> What\\'s it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> He gave you his eye?\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Thank you, sweet rabbit.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thor proceeds to put the eyeball in his socket. We are thankfully spared the explicit insertion.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would\\'ve washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...<i>[beeping] </i>Hey, we\\'re here!\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> <i>[Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated]</i> I don\\'t think this thing works. Everything seems dark.\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> It ain\\'t the eye.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Nidavellir is dark and motionless as the three rings around it.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Something\\'s wrong. The star\\'s gone out. And the rings are frozen.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title: NIDAVELLIR]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The pod sets down; Thor, Rocket and Groot disembark and start walking through a seemingly abandoned and cluttered space. Groot is still playing his game.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> This forge hasn\\'t gone dark in centuries....\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> <i>[Pauses, looking at a pedestal]</i> You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Yes. Why?\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> Look anything like that? <i>[In fact, it looks exactly like that]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Groot:</b> <i>[Uneasily]</i> I am Groot.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> <i>[Urgently]</i> Go back to the pod.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Suddenly a massive figure storms towards them, flinging Thor away with one swing of his arm, and kicking Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Eitri, wait! Stop!\\n</p>, <p><b>Eitri:</b> Thor?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Eitri is played by the legendary Peter Dinklage -- his giant size literally juxtaposing his name of dwarf.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> What happened here?\\n</p>, <p><b>Eitri:</b> You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Asgard is destroyed. <i>[Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.]</i> Eitri, the glove. What did you do?\\n</p>, <p><b>Eitri:</b> <i>[He walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.]</i> 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they\\'d be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. \\'Your life is yours,\\' he said. \\'But your hands are mine alone.\\' <i>[He holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> Eitri, this isn\\'t about your hands.

But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Cut to Nebula suspended in the interrogation room seen earlier, while a technician puts her back together.

Thanos punches Drax through a ruined wall, then shatters the blade with one hand and tears the web from his eyes. He advances on Doctor Strange and kicks at him, but Strange\\'s shield absorbs the damage -- the Cloak lifts him free of the ground.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Star-Lord has been making his way back on the ground, and shoots Thanos from behind. Thanos uses the Power Stone to shoot balls of energy at Star-Lord while Star-Lord leaps towards Thanos using magical platforms thrown in his path by Doctor Strange, the last one placed above Thanos\\' head so Star-Lord can flip over him and slap a mine on Thanos\\' back. Star-Lord sticks his landing, he disengages his helmet, flips Thanos a bird and falls backward into a portal.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Quill:</b> Boom!\\n</p>, <p><i>[The explosion knocks Thanos to his knees and dazes him briefly.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen</b> <b>Strange:</b> <i>[Whispers to the Cloak of Levitation]</i> Do not let him close his fist. <i>[The Cloak swoops off Doctor Strange\\'s shoulders and wraps itself tightly around Thanos\\' armored hand, who starts tugging at this unexpected wrapping.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Doctor Strange starts throwing portals everywhere.

He yanks on the Crimson Bands holding his right hand to throw Doctor Strange far away, and swats away Iron Man and his repulsor shots. The remaining Guardians jump up and charge him again, but he fires a pulse of indigo energy at them that knocks the three of them completely unconscious.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Iron Man zooms back in, his nanite arm cannon manifested, and is head-butted to the ground. Thanos looks at him for a beat, then raises the gauntlet towards Titan\\'s moon. Iron Man stares, aghast. Thanos uses a combination of the Power and Space Stones to shatter the moon\\'s surface, then bring the debris down on the field of battle at speed. Iron Man powers out of the way but is caught by a chunk of moon about the size of a baseball field, slamming him into the ground. The Guardians go sailing into the air from the rebound.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Back in Wakanda, Shuri is working steadily to complete the Mind Stone\\'s removal; Wanda stands by tensely]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Kingsguard, Borderers and Jabari have little success going against Cull Obsidian\\'s chained hammer -- he either sends them flying or punches them into the ground.

I am Steve Rogers.\\n</p>, <p><i>[In Shuri\\'s lab, a deep rumbling can be heard even at their height. Wanda looks down on the battlefield, and sees movement through the blazing forest between the troopships and the dome. When the disturbance reaches the edge of the trees, it turns into vast moving mounds of earth that easily bypass the force field and emerge -- Threshers, sets of massive, motorized spiked wheels, intended for nothing more than shredding everything in their paths.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>T\\'Challa:</b> <i>Fall back! Fall back now!</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Wanda watches as at least one set of Threshers separates into individual wheels and starts veering all over the battlefield, and then looks anxiously back at Vision]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>James Rhodes:</b> Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.\\n</p>, <p><b>Sam Wilson:</b> I\\'m doing it. <i>[The two fliers use their firepower to crack a Thresher but cannot find a weak spot.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Black Widow with her escrima sticks and Okoye with her augmented spear have drifted together when they\\'re suddenly in the path of a Thresher. Both women cringe at their seemingly inevitable shredding when the Scarlet Witch lands in front of both of them, eyes glowing red, lifting the whole Thresher well clear of the ground. Looking behind her, the friendly forces have scattered and replaced by a charging mob of Outriders -- the perfect place to throw a Thresher. Black Widow straightens with a pleased smile, Okoye with an amazed look.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Okoye:</b> <i>[A touch indignant]</i> Why was she up there all this time?\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Children of Thanos help answer that question.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Proxima Midnight:</b> She\\'s on the field.

She starts hastily disconnecting her equipment from Vision\\'s systems; he gasps at the sensations. The Dora Milaje engages Glaive but is sent skidding across the floor. Shuri finishes her shutdown, grabs one of her sonic panther-paws and fires at Glaive. The Dora attacks again, and Glaive sends both her and Shuri through the balcony railing and onto the main lab floor.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Vision is not where Corvus Glaive expects to find him.

She blocks Proxima\\'s blow with an electrical crackle while Okoye runs around the slope to also attack from the front.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Corvus Glaive kicks Vision, knocking him down; as he attempts to rise again, Cull Obsidian shows up and swings his hammer in a full arc, throwing Vision even further. He painfully starts to climb to his feet again when a whooshing overhead interrupts the fight as Bruce Banner lands the Hulkbuster between the aliens and the android. He takes a defensive stance, pointing one hand\\'s repulsor at each.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Bruce Banner:</b> Oh no, oh no you don\\'t. This isn\\'t going to be like New York, pal. This suit\\'s already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-- <i>[Cull Obsidian jumps forward, grabs Bruce\\'s right arm and Bruce in reflex grabs Obsidian\\'s hammer; a jet fires, taking the two of them in a random direction, to the base of a waterfall.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Bruce Banner:</b> Guys!

Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, <i>last</i> second. <i>[Bruce extends his left hand protectively; Obsidian grabs the armor\\'s hand, chops the shoulder joint with a relatively small axe then does a roll over Bruce\\'s back to leverage snapping off the Hulkbuster\\'s whole arm]</i> Ahhhhh! Hulk! <i>Hulk!</i> <i>HULK!</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Hulk:</b> <i>[Banner\\'s face briefly becomes the Hulk] NOOOO!!!</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Bruce Banner:</b> Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I\\'ll do it myself! <i>[To Obsidian]</i> Come on!\\n</p>, <p><i>[He charges the alien, jumps into the air and delivers an effective punch with his remaining hand -- swat, punch, hammer -- except that blow is caught by Obsidian, who punches back, knocking Bruce flat. Obsidian changes his left hand armor into a pointed weapon, and lunges forward to deliver a likely fatal blow, when Bruce grabs the detached Hulkbuster arm out of the water, holding it so Obsidian impales that instead, and slaps the controls.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Bruce Banner:</b> See ya! <i>[The repulsors fire, taking Cull Obsidian high into the air -- high enough, in fact, to intersect the defense dome. The Hulkbuster arm drags Obsidian against the field to grotesque destructive effect, ending in a very final explosion.]</i> Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Proxima Midnight alternates heavy blows between her two opponents, but all three of them duck as a single-wheel Thresher tears overhead, the ditch sparing them most of the danger from the wheel-blades. Proxima uses the distraction to kick Black Widow in the face, sending her to the ground. She then grabs Okoye by the shoulder and weapon and throws her meters away.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Simultaneously, Corvus Glaive and Vision struggle in the forest at the foot of Mount Bashenga. Glaive grasps Vision\\'s shoulder and uses the leverage to plunge his blade once more into the android\\'s chest.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Corvus Glaive:</b> I thought you were formidable, machine.

The alien takes to her bare fists instead, knocks down and pins the Black Widow. Proxima triggers an arm-blade from her left-arm armor, and stabs at Black Widow, who barely manages to block the blade with her crossed sticks. As the edge starts to dig into Black Widow\\'s neck anyway, scarlet energy grabs the alien and tosses her into the air right into the path of another passing Thresher. Dark blue blood spatters the women below. The Scarlet Witch sits up, sighing with relief, her hands still shimmering.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Natasha Romanoff:</b> That was really gross.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Captain America keeps blocking Corvus Glaive\\'s staff weapon using his shields, finally knocking it from the alien\\'s hands just before he\\'s thrown over a fallen tree and pinned, Glaive\\'s hand at his throat. Even with his physical abilities, Captain America\\'s struggling -- until a glaive-blade pierces Glaive\\'s chest, and is pushed all the way through. Vision raises his enemy in a perfect mirror of the first attack on him, and holds him for a moment, before dropping Glaive\\'s corpse to one side and collapsing exhaustively.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Steve Rogers:</b> <i>[helping him back up]</i> I thought I told you to go.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vision:</b> We don\\'t trade lives, Captain.\\n</p>, <p><i>[The remaining Guardians and Avengers are dealing with the gravitic aftermath of dumping a large chunk of moon onto an unstable planet\\'s surface. The unconscious Guardians are flying upwards uncontrollably, moon-chunks are still making fiery ballistic in-bounds, and random debris and massive rocks are floating in any possible direction. Spider-Man is well-equipped to handle this physically, even if he\\'s freaking out emotionally.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> <i>[Webs Mantis]</i> I got you! I got you! <i>[Snags Drax, securing both of them to something not moving]</i> I\\'m sorry I can\\'t remember anybody\\'s names! <i>[Reels in Star-Lord]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Cloak of Levitation sets Doctor Strange down on a relatively stable outcrop as Thanos extricates himself from rubble. The Sorcerer Supreme makes a few passes with his hands, producing the familiar golden magic filigree circles, and slams his hands down on the rock before him, invoking the Seven Suns of Cinnibus as a lightning-like effect of immense heat jumping from rock to rock until it reaches Thanos, sending him flying -- but he makes use of the erratic gravity to keep control and fire back a blast from the Power Stone.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Doctor Strange blocks the purple plume with a wall of Mirror Dimension, which he then pushes back at Thanos. It shatters around the Titan, who suctions the magic into a miniature black hole with the Space Stone, volleying it back at Doctor Strange. Just in time, Doctor Strange raises a shield and changes the dark energy into a swarm of aqua butterflies which return to their master.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Before Thanos can counterattack again, Doctor Strange levitates and invokes the Images of Ikonn, giving him arms like a Hindu deity before dozens of Strange replications rush away, forming a circular wall around a snarling Thanos. They call cast magical cords, wrapping around Thanos\\' torso, arms and hands; he struggles to close his gauntleted fist, and uses the Soul and Power Stones to discover the real Doctor Strange among the many copies, blowing the duplicates away and sending the singular Doctor Strange reeling. Reality and Space pull Doctor Strange forward, Thanos grasping him by the throat once in range. Doctor Strange grabs futilely at Thanos\\' hand.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> You\\'re full of tricks, wizard.\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> <i>[as Thanos reaches for the Eye of Agamotto]</i> <i>No!</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[He snaps the Eye off its chain]</i> Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. <i>[He crushes it in his bare hand]</i> A fake. <i>[He throws Doctor Strange hard enough that Doctor Strange\\'s head hits stone and he passes out.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Almost simultaneously, a red and gold device slaps into the palm of the Infinity Gauntlet, bracing the fingers open; and a red and gold Avenger makes a fast and hard entrance.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> <i>[sounding just about done with the Titan] </i>You throw another moon at me, and I\\'m gonna to lose it.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> Stark.\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> You know me?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> I do.

Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos shakes it off quickly, reaches forward and tears Iron Man\\'s helmet off, revealing Tony\\'s surprised expression before the suit recovers automatically and re-forms his head protection. The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos\\' face, cutting his cheek.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[Panting]</i> All that for a drop of blood.\\n</p>, <p><i>[He smiles briefly punches Iron Man, sending him pinwheeling, then starts beating him with his fists. Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony\\'s head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos\\' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what\\'s left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony\\'s left side. The fight is over.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos walks Tony back until he sits, and places the gauntlet almost comfortingly on Tony\\'s head.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> You have my respect, Stark.

He opens his hand, the scars on his fingers and their inherent trembling particularly obvious now, and the Stone floats to Thanos\\' bare hand. Doctor Strange watches him intently, as he takes the Stone and drops it into the thumb setting, the energy pulse making the Titan wince.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> One to go. <i>[An energy blast hits the gauntlet right in the empty Mind Stone setting, and Thanos grimaces in surprise.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Quill:</b> <i>[Screaming in incoherent rage, helmet up, firing with both hands and flying straight for Thanos.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos doesn\\'t even bother responding to the assault -- he just leaves.

Stay sharp.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Bruce reaches Thanos first, lunging forward fist-first -- but Thanos uses the Space Stone on him, renders him immaterial until the Hulkbuster is half-buried in the stone of the cliff behind him, and freezes Bruce in place.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Captain America is sent flying by purple energy before he even gets to strike a single blow.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Black Panther, armor fully charged kinetically, leaps high and with claws extended, but is easily grabbed by the throat and punched to the ground, his armor discharging violently.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Falcon stoops, strafing with both Steyr pistols, but is felled when his wings become rubbery and unable to sustain flight.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Vision:</b> Wanda. It\\'s time.\\n</p>, <p><b>Wanda Maximoff:</b> No.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vision:</b> They can\\'t stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.\\n</p>, <p><b>Wanda Maximoff:</b> Don\\'t.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vision:</b> You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time.\\n</p>, <p><b>Wanda Maximoff:</b> I can\\'t.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vision:</b> Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.\\n</p>, <p><b>Wanda Maximoff:</b> It\\'s not fair.\\n</p>, <p><b>Vision:</b> It shouldn\\'t be you, but it is. It\\'s all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. <i>[The Scarlet Witch extends a trembling hand and starts beaming her energy at the Mind Stone.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The following action is mostly muted. War Machine joins the fight, firing his guns at Thanos until he uses the gauntlet to crush his armor around him and toss him aside.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Winter Soldier runs in firing, and is punched away by the Power Stone.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Okoye activates the Vibranium-powered elements on her spear and flings it; Power stops it inches from Thanos, and throws her and it aside while wrapping the Black Widow in inescapable bands of earth.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Groot stabs his hands into the ground to wrap Thanos in cables of roots, which he breaks easily.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Scarlet Witch watches all this over one shoulder, and turns back to Vision to add her left hand to her tearful effort.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Captain America slides under one blow and comes up swinging his deployed arm-shields, punching Thanos in the gut and chin. He grabs the gauntlet, keeping Thanos\\' fingers un-clenched. Thanos looks very briefly impressed at Captain America\\'s efforts as he screams before slamming a fist into his head and rendering him insensible.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The Scarlet Witch looks over her shoulder again and sees Thanos approaching unopposed. She swings her left hand around to fend him off with a stream of scarlet energy, and pushes him back despite his blue-purple energy shield, but then he starts to make slow headway.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Vision:</b> <i>[Very softly]</i> It\\'s all right. It\\'s all right. I love you.\\n</p>, <p><i>[At those words, the yellow Mind Stone finally starts to crack. Vision\\'s face is overcome by an expression of joyful peace, and as the crystal fragments completely, a pulse of pure yellow energy explodes from him, shuddering the trees for many meters around his epicenter. Wanda\\'s and Thanos\\' energy subsides.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[Walking closer to the Scarlet Witch]</i> I understand, my child. Better than anyone.\\n</p>, <p><b>Wanda Maximoff:</b> <i>[Snarls]</i> You could never.\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[Reaches down to presume to stroke her hair, as if in comfort]</i> Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. <i>[He reaches forward, clenching the gauntlet, emerald filigree surrounding his wrist, making a gesture very similar to that Doctor Strange made when activating the Eye of Agamotto. In response, a bead of yellow light starts gathering in on itself as time is reversed and growing in size, solidifying into an intact and conscious Vision]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Wanda Maximoff:</b> <i>No!</i> <i>[She lunges for Vision and is swatted away.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos picks up Vision by the throat, lifting him to eye-level, and digs the fingers of his right hand into Vision\\'s forehead, digging out the Mind Stone. He pulls it loose, and Vision goes limp and colorless; he tosses the lifeless android aside like trash. Bringing his gauntleted hand up, he slowly moves the Mind Stone over the last empty setting, and drops it in. The energy surge is much more than any previous -- his torso is wreathed with iridescent static and he bellows from the sensations.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[As Thanos studies the completed gauntlet, a massive bolt of lighting strikes him, digging him into the ground and grinding him back for meters. Thor has arrived, eyes glowing with power, stooping down from the sky like a bird of prey. The God of Thunder pauses his attack, reverses his position, raises Stormbreaker above his head and hurls it -- Thanos fires the whole might of the gauntlet against it, but it only creates a rainbow-like bow-shock, not slowing the ax as it slams right into Thanos\\' chest. ]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> <i>[Lands in front of Thanos, who is down on one knee; hatefully.]</i> I told you. You\\'d die for that. <i>[reffering to the deaths of Loki and Heimdall]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[He takes hold of the back of Thanos\\' head and forces Stormbreaker deeper into his chest, staring angrily into his eyes while Thanos cries out in pain]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[Weakly]</i> You should have... you... <i>[suddenly stronger]</i> <i>You should have gone for the head.</i> <i>[He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> <i>NO!</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[The scene whites out. It cuts sharply to a view of Thanos his hand on his chest, no wounds visible. Thanos now seems to be inside the Soul Stone, where he sees a child and the pavilion from the home world of the Zen-Whoberi.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> Daughter?\\n</p>, <p><i>[the child turns around revealing to be Young Gamora.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> Did you do it?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> Yes.\\n</p>, <p><b>Gamora:</b> <i>[Beat]</i> What did it cost?\\n</p>, <p><b>Thanos:</b> <i>[Solemnly]</i> <i>Everything</i>.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Now out of the Soul World, Thanos is snapped back to normal reality, and notices the damage inflicted on the gauntlet -- the metal scorched and distorted from heat, the stones no longer glowing.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Thor:</b> What\\'d you do? <i>[Angrily]</i> WHAT\\'D YOU DO?!\\n</p>, <p><i>[Thanos nearly seems to not notice Thor before he uses the Space Stone and teleports away, leaving Stormbreaker behind on Wakandan ground.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Steve Rogers:</b> <i>[Stumbles into the clearing, holding his left side]</i> Where\\'d he go? Thor... where\\'d he go?\\n</p>, <p><b>Bucky Barnes:</b> Steve?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Bucky suddenly stumbles over, drops his gun and collapses into ashes, much to Steve\\'s shock; he walks over and touches the ground where Bucky\\'s ashes evaporated disbelievingly.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes, much to M\\'Baku\\'s horror.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>T\\'Challa:</b> <i>[While reaching for a fallen Okoye]</i> Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. <i>[King T\\'Challa holds out his hand for Okoye. He suddenly disintegrates into ashes and, in anguish, Okoye falls back on the ground. Few seconds later, she gets up herself.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Okoye:</b> <i>Kumkani?!</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Groot:</b> <i>[Slowly corrodes into ashes as well by Rocket]</i> I am Groot... <i>[TRANSLATION: \"Dad?\"]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[off-screen Okoye repeats herself]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Rocket:</b> No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no...\\n</p>, <p><i>[Wanda is mourning over Vision. She then turns into ashes. An injured Sam turns to ashes, hidden in the undergrowth.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>James Rhodes:</b> <i>[Searching for Sam, missing him by only a few feet]</i> Sam?<i> [Back to Okoye is is whimpering for her disintegrated king] </i>Sam, where you at?!\\n</p>, <p><i>[On Titan, the remaining members of the Guardians and Avengers collect themselves -- Mantis props up Star-Lord, Spider-Man helps Tony to his feet, Drax and Nebula manage to limp over on their own.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Mantis:</b> Something\\'s... happening. <i>[She disintegrates into ashes.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Quill looks behind him as he sees Drax disintegrate]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Drax:</b> <i>[To Quill as he dissolves]</i> Quill?\\n</p>, <p><i>[Quill stares in horror as he turns back to Stark.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> <i>[Staring panicked at the slowly fading Quill]</i> Steady, Quill.\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Quill:</b> Oh, man. <i>[Quill also gets disintegrated into ashes]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Stephen Strange:</b> <i>[Calmly turns to Stark]</i> Tony, there was no other way. <i>[He finally gets erased.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> <i>[Realizes he\\'s fading away]</i> Mr. Stark? <i>[Stark stares horrified at Parker,]</i> I don\\'t feel so good...\\n</p>, <p><b>Tony Stark:</b> <i>[Trying to be calm, his voice shaking as he looks at Peter in terror]</i> You\\'re all right?\\n</p>, <p><b>Peter Parker:</b> <i>[Stumbling and terrified]</i> I don\\'t know what\\'s -- I don\\'t know what\\'s happening.

[T<i>here is a short silence before Peter speaks again</i>] <i>I\\'m sorry.</i> <i>[Parker disintegrates into ashes in Stark\\'s arms.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><i>[Tony falls forward from the lack of weight in his arms, before staring at his hands in disbelief.]</i>\\n</p>, <p><b>Nebula:</b> <i>[To Tony Stark, seeing Thanos\\' victory.]</i> He did it.\\n</p>, <p><i>[Stark mourns silently at their failure.

It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud of \\nGLITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform.  As a \\nTRAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickering \\nwindows and watches the dust transform into... ALBUS \\nDUMBLEDORE.  Leveling his glasses, he peers across the \\nplatform, smiles and gives Harry a wave.\\n\\n13\\n\\nEXT. OPPOSITE PLATFORM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)\\n\\n13\\n\\nAs Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUME \\nADVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in her \\nteeth:  “Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man.”\\n\\nDUMBLEDORE\\n\\nI once knew a Muggle girl from \\nLiverpool with hair like spun \\nsilk.

Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but \\nnothing else.  He starts down the hallway, toward the \\nOPEN DOORWAY at its end.  Slowly, the room beyond comes \\nINTO VIEW:\\n\\n\\x0cHARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07       10.\\n\\n16\\n\\nINT. SLUGHORN’S HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\n16\\n\\nUtter devastation.  A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon the \\nfloor, its face cracked.  A PIANO sags in the corner, \\nkeys strewn like teeth upon the rug.  A copy of the Daily \\nProphet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window.  \\nAs Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word \\n“CHOSEN.”  His gaze rises.\\n\\nHe GASPS.

Harry raises his own, \\naiming through the grid, poised.  Just then, a SHADOW \\nsplinters through the columns to his right.  He looks, \\nfinds Snape, quiet as a ghost, peering upward.  \\nCarefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a \\nfinger to his lips:  Shhh.  Then he is drifting upward.  \\nSilent.  A ghost again.\\n\\nGREYBACK\\nHe doesn’t have the stomach.  Like \\nhis father.  Let me finish him.  \\nIn my own way.\\n\\nBELLATRIX\\n\\nNo!  The Dark Lord was clear.  The \\nboy’s to do it.

For a second he hangs, suspended upon the \\nramparts, and then... the night swallows him.\\n\\nHARRY SCREAMS in RAGE.  Bellatrix raises her wand to the \\nsky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, masking \\nHarry’s cry.  The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT, \\nmutating into a SKULL.  As the Death Eaters flee, Snape’s \\narm drops limply to his side.\\n\\nYou can no longer stay here.\\n\\nSNAPE\\n\\nDraco, stunned, stares at the empty place where \\nDumbledore stood only seconds before.  Snape takes him by \\nthe scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then \\nfollows.\\n\\nHarry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the \\nramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above.

Bellatrix lags, \\nthen steps to the TOWERING DOORS of the Hall, peering \\nupward, past the FLOATING CANDLES to the vaulted ceiling, \\nsolemn as a church.  Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY \\nBOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite.  As it EXPLODES, a \\nBLAST of COLD AIR sweeps the room, EXTINGUISHING THE \\nCANDLES.  Snape turns, looks back.

Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and \\nblack against the raging fire.  Harry points his wand, \\nfires a JET of RED LIGHT.  Snape doesn’t move, merely \\nlets it streak by his head.  Harry stops, chest heaving, \\nand takes aim again.\\n\\nSnape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.\\n\\nOnce again, Snape deflects the spell.\\n\\nCruciatus!\\n\\nIncacerata!\\n\\nImpedimenta!\\n\\nHARRY\\n\\nHARRY\\n\\nHARRY\\n\\nHARRY\\n\\nAnother lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated.  \\nHarry drops his arm in frustration.\\n\\nFight!

They head for the darkness of the \\ntreeline.  And VANISH.  Harry pounds his fist into the \\nground, then stops.\\n\\nHagrid...

They turn \\nand watch the throng of students part for Harry and \\nHagrid.\\n\\nHagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees.  Harry \\npushes on, kneels.  Dumbledore’s eyes are closed, his \\nface peaceful.  Harry straightens his half-moon \\nspectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.  \\nRuns the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered \\ncheek.\\n\\nThen he notices something lying beside Dumbledore’s ashen \\nhand:  the locket.  He takes it, considers it numbly.  \\nThen begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his \\nbody.  Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps \\nforward, drops beside him.  At her touch, his head falls \\non her shoulder and she begins to stroke him.  Ron looks \\non.  Understands all.\\n\\nMcGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly \\nthe TIP GLOWS to life.  One after another, students and \\nstaff do the same, lifting their wands in salute.

Looks \\ndown.\\n\\nDumbledore’s wand.\\n\\nReaching out, Harry takes it in hand.  Old, oft-used and \\nbearing the impression of its owner’s fingers, it is a \\nstrangely beautiful object.
